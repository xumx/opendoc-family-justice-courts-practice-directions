(c) For the avoidance of doubt, electronically stored documents residing in folders or directories in storage locations, media or devices, including folders or directories where temporarily deleted files are located (for example the Recycle Bin folder or Trash folder) are within the scope of general discovery; deleted files or file fragments containing information which are recoverable through the use of computer forensic tools or techniques during a forensic inspection of the unallocated file space or file slack are not within the scope of general discovery. (d) Reasonable search. The search terms or phrases specified in the first column will be used in the conduct of a reasonable search for relevant electronically stored documents. The reasonable search will be limited by the scope described in the second column. Search term or phrase Scope [Specify the keyword(s).] [Describe the scope of the search by reference to physical or logical storage locations media or devices, the period during which the requested electronically stored document was created, modified or received, etc.] (2) Format of list The list of documents shall categorise and list electronically stored documents separately from documents in printed or other form.

(4) Inspection and copies (a) Arrangements for inspection. The place for inspection of discoverable electronic documents should be stated separately if it is different from the place for inspection of other discoverable documents. If the party entitled to inspect intends to inspect through or with the assistance of its appointed computer expert, such computer expert shall provide an undertaking of confidentiality to the party giving inspection before he commences his inspection. (b) Supply of copies. During inspection, copies shall not be taken. If copies are required, a request should be made.

"text": "Part 2: Protocol for Inspection of Computer Databases and Electronic Media or Recording Devices (1) Appointment of computer experts (a) Joint appointment. The party producing the computer database, electronic medium or recording device for inspection (“the Producing Party”) and the party entitled to inspection of the computer database, electronic medium or recording device (“the Inspecting Party”), may jointly appoint a computer expert (“the Joint Expert”) for the purpose of making a forensic copy of such computer database, electronic medium or recording device (“the Original Acquired Image”). The Joint Expert’s role shall be restricted to the acquisition of the Original Acquired Image and the performance of a reasonable search on a copy of the Original Acquired Image in accordance with the terms of this protocol. Before the Joint Expert commences his appointment, he shall provide an undertaking of confidentiality to the Court and to all parties concerned in the inspection. He shall also procure a similar undertaking from each of his employees, representatives, agents or sub-contractors involved in the engagement. (b) Costs and expenses of Joint Expert. All costs and expenses relating to the appointment of the Joint Expert under this protocol shall initially be borne equally between the Producing Party and the Inspecting Party. Nothing in this protocol is intended to or shall be taken to prevent any party to the cause or matter from seeking the recovery of such costs and expenses in accordance with the Family Justice Rules. (c) Individual appointments. Nothing in this protocol shall prevent the Producing Party, the Inspecting Party and any other party concerned in the inspection from appointing his own computer expert. (2) Acquisition of the Original Acquired Image (a) Where Joint Expert appointed. The Joint Expert shall acquire the Original Acquired Image under the supervision of all parties concerned in the inspection, their representatives or computer experts. Sufficient copies of the Original Acquired Image shall be made as necessary in order that the Producing Party and each Inspecting Party may be supplied with an electronic copy of the Original Acquired Image. The Joint Expert shall provide sufficient information with the copy of the Original Acquired Image to enable the party’s computer expert to access the copy supplied. The Original Acquired Image shall be sealed and delivered to the custody of the Producing Party, who shall enumerate it in a list of documents to be filed under Part 18 Division 19 of the Family Justice Rules. (b) Where Joint Expert not appointed. The Producing Party’s computer expert shall be responsible for acquiring the Original Acquired Image under the supervision of all parties concerned in the inspection, their representatives or computer experts. Sufficient copies of the Original Acquired Image shall be made as necessary for the purposes of inspection and reasonable search to be provided under this protocol. The Original Acquired Image shall be sealed and delivered to the custody of the Producing Party, who shall enumerate it in a list of documents to be filed under Part 18 Division 19 of the Family Justice Rules. (c) Original Acquired Image to be produced when ordered by Court. The party to whose custody the sealed Original Acquired Image has been delivered shall not tamper with or break the seal, and shall produce the Original Acquired Image to the Court or such other person(s) as the Court may direct. (3) Safeguards for reasonable search This paragraph applies in situations where a reasonable search is conducted on the contents of a copy of the Original Acquired Image. Where Joint Expert appointed (a) Conduct of reasonable search. The Inspecting Party shall specify or describe the search terms or phrases to be used in a reasonable search to be conducted on the contents of a copy of the Original Acquired Image to the Producing Party and the Joint Expert. If the Producing Party does not object to the search terms or phrases so specified or described, he shall communicate his consent to the Joint Expert and the Inspecting Party. The Joint Expert shall make arrangements for the conduct of the reasonable search on a copy of the Original Acquired Image under the supervision of all parties concerned in the inspection, their representatives or computer experts. If the Producing Party objects to any or all of the search terms or phrases so specified or described, he shall forthwith inform the Joint Expert. The parties shall resolve such objections before any further steps are taken for the conduct of the reasonable search. The Joint Expert shall not take any further steps for the conduct of the reasonable search until: (i) he is informed by the Producing Party of his consent to the original search terms or phrases; or (ii) the Inspecting Party specifies or describes a new set of search terms or phrases and to which the Producing Party provides his consent in accordance with this sub-paragraph. A copy of the documents or records that are the results of the reasonable search (“the Search Results”) shall be made and released to the Producing Party. (b) Review for privileged material. The Producing Party shall be at liberty to review the Search Results for the purpose of claiming privilege. If the Producing Party claims privilege over any document or record from the Search Results, he shall list the electronic documents or records over which privilege is claimed. (c) Release for inspection. Thereafter, the Joint Expert shall remove copies of any documents or records over which privilege is claimed from the Search Results (“the Redacted Search Results”). The Joint Expert may maintain a separate privilege log which records the documents or records which are thus removed and the reasons given for doing so. For the avoidance of doubt, the privilege log shall not be included in the Joint Expert’s report but the Joint Expert shall produce the privilege log to the Court if so directed by the Court. The Redacted Search Results shall be released to the Inspecting Party for inspection together with the list of electronic documents or records over which privilege is claimed. Where Joint Expert not appointed (d) Conduct of reasonable search. The Inspecting Party shall specify or describe the search terms or phrases to be used in a reasonable search to be conducted on the contents of a copy of the Original Acquired Image to the Producing Party. If the Producing Party objects to any or all of the search terms or phrases so specified or described, parties shall resolve such objections before any further steps are taken for the conduct of the reasonable search. Upon resolution of any objections or if the Producing Party consents to the specified or described search terms or phrases, he shall make arrangements for his computer expert to conduct the requested reasonable search on a copy of the Original Acquired Image under the supervision of all parties concerned in the inspection, their representatives or computer experts. (e) Review for privileged material. The Producing Party shall be at liberty to review the Search Results for the purpose of claiming privilege. If the Producing Party claims privilege over any document or record from the Search Results, he shall list the electronic documents or records over which privilege is claimed. (f) Release for inspection. Thereafter, the Producing Party shall remove copies of any documents or records over which privilege is claimed from the Search Results. The Redacted Search Results shall be released to the Inspecting Party for inspection together with the list of electronic documents or records over which privilege is claimed. (4) Safeguards for forensic examination This paragraph applies to the forensic examination of a copy of the Original Acquired Image for the purpose of identifying electronically stored documents thereon or for the recovery of deleted files or file fragments from the unallocated file space or file slack using computer forensic tools or techniques. A Joint Expert shall be appointed for the purpose of such forensic examination. (a) Conduct of forensic examination. The Inspecting Party shall specify or describe the search terms or phrases to be used in the forensic examination to be conducted on the contents of a copy of the Original Acquired Image to the Joint Expert. The Joint Expert shall not at any time disclose to the Producing Party the search terms or phrases specified or described by the Inspecting Party and shall not include the search terms or phrases in his report. For the avoidance of doubt, the Joint Expert shall disclose the search terms or phrases to the Court if so directed by the Court. The Joint Expert shall make arrangements for the conduct of the forensic examination on a copy of the Original Acquired Image. Neither the Inspecting Party nor the Producing Party, or any of their solicitors, computer experts, employees, representatives or agents shall be present during the conduct of the forensic examination. A copy of the documents or records that are the results of the reasonable search (“the Search Results”) shall be made and released to the Producing Party. The Producing Party is not entitled to a copy, and shall not request the Joint Expert for a copy, of the search terms or phrases specified or described by the Inspecting Party. (b) Review for privileged material. The Joint Expert and the Producing Party shall jointly review the Search Results for the purpose of permitting the Producing Party to identify electronically stored documents, deleted files or file fragments over which he claims privilege. If the Producing Party claims privilege over any electronically stored documents, deleted files or file fragments from the Search Results, he shall identify them to the Joint Expert. The Producing Party shall list the electronic documents, deleted files or file fragments over which privilege is claimed. (c) Release for inspection. Thereafter, the Joint Expert shall remove copies of any electronic documents, deleted files or file fragments over which privilege is claimed from the Search Results (“the Redacted Search Results”). The Joint Expert may maintain a separate privilege log which records the electronic documents, deleted files or file fragments which are thus removed and the reasons provided for the removal. For the avoidance of doubt, the privilege log shall not be included in the Joint Expert’s report but the Joint Expert shall produce the privilege log to the Court if so directed by the Court. The Redacted Search Results shall be released to the Inspecting Party for inspection together with the Producing Party’s list of electronic documents, deleted files or file fragments over which privilege is claimed. (5) Inadvertent disclosure of privileged documents Notwithstanding compliance with the procedures in this protocol, nothing in this protocol is intended to be or shall be taken to amount to a waiver of privilege. (6) Discovery and production only if necessary For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this protocol shall compel any party to give discovery of any document or produce any document for inspection which is not otherwise discoverable under rules 468 or 474 of the Family Justice Rules."

Identification numbers to be stated in cause papers Parties named in the title of the documents (1) Where a party to any proceedings in the Family Justice Courts first files a document in such proceedings, he shall state his identification number (in brackets), in the title of the document immediately below or after his name. Thereafter, all documents subsequently filed in the proceedings by any party shall include this identification number in the title of the documents. Parties not named in the title of the documents (2) Where a party to any proceedings in the Family Justice Courts first files a document in such proceedings, and the name of the party does not appear in the title of the document but does appear in the body of the document, then the identification number of the party should be stated (in brackets), below or after the first appearance of his name in the document. Thereafter, all documents subsequently filed in the proceedings by any party shall include this identification number in parentheses immediately below or after the first appearance of the name of the party to which it applies in the subsequent document. Documents filed by two or more parties (3) Sub-paragraphs (1) and (2) shall apply, with the necessary modifications, to documents which are filed by more than one party. Identification numbers for non-parties (4) If any person (living or dead), any entity or any property is in part or in whole the subject matter of any proceedings, or is affected by any proceedings, but is not a party thereto, and the name of such person, entity or property is to appear in the title of the documents filed in the proceedings, the party filing the first document in the proceedings must state the identification number of such person, entity or property (in brackets) immediately below or after the name of the same. Thereafter, all documents subsequently filed in the proceedings by any party shall include this identification number (in brackets) immediately below or after the name of the person, entity or property to which it applies. If the party filing the first document in the proceedings is unable, after reasonable enquiry, to discover the identification number of the person, entity or property, he may state immediately below or after the name of the same “(ID No. not known)”. All documents subsequently filed by any party shall then contain these words (in brackets) below or after the name of this person, entity or property. Special cases (5) The following Directions shall apply in addition to the Directions contained in sub- paragraphs (1) to (4): (a) where a party is represented by a litigation representative or guardian in adoption or deputy, sub-paragraphs (1) to (3) shall apply to the litigation representative or guardian in adoption or deputy as if he or she was a party to the proceedings, and the identification numbers of the party, the litigation representative and/or guardian in adoption and/or deputy must be stated below or after the name of each, as appropriate; (b) where parties are involved in any proceedings as the personal representatives of the estate of a deceased person, sub-paragraphs (1) to (3) shall apply to the deceased person as if he were a party; and (c) where more than one identification number applies to any party, person, entity or property, all the identification numbers shall be stated in any convenient order. Identification numbers (6) When entering the identification number in the Electronic Filing Service, the full identification number should be entered, including any letters or characters that appear in, at the beginning of, or at the end of the number. Descriptive text which is required to be entered into the actual document, such as “Japanese Identification Card No.”, should not be entered into the electronic form. Guidelines for the selection of identification numbers (7) The following guidelines should be followed in deciding on the appropriate identification number. (a) Natural person with Singapore identity card For a natural person who is a Singapore citizen or permanent resident, the identification number shall be the number of the identity card issued under the National Registration Act (Cap. 201). The 7 digit number as well as the letters at the front and end should be stated. For example: “(NRIC No. S1234567A)”. (b) Natural person with FIN number For a natural person, whether a Singapore citizen or permanent resident or not, who has not been issued with an identity card under the National Registration Act, but has been assigned a FIN number under the Immigration Regulations (Cap. 133, Rg 1), the identification number shall be the FIN number. The number should be preceded by the prefix “FIN No.” (c) Natural person: birth certificate or passport number For a natural person, whether a Singapore citizen or permanent resident or not, who has not been issued with an identity card under the National Registration Act or assigned a FIN number, the identification number shall be the birth certificate or passport number. The number should be preceded by either of the following, as appropriate, “(Issuing country) BC No.” or “(Issuing country) PP No.” (d) Natural person: other numbers For a natural person who is not a Singapore citizen or permanent resident and has not been assigned a FIN number and does not have a birth certificate or passport number, the identification number shall be the number of any identification document he may possess. Both the number as well as some descriptive words which will enable the nature of the number given and the authority issuing the identification document to be ascertained, should be stated. For example: “Japanese Identification Card No.” (e) Deceased person For a deceased natural person, the identification number shall be as set out in sub-paragraph (7)(a) to (d) above. However, if such numbers are not available, the identification number shall be the death registration number under the Registration of Births and Deaths Rules (Cap. 267, R 1) or the equivalent foreign provisions, where the death is registered abroad. The number as well as the following words should be stated: “(Country or place of registration of death) Death Reg. No.” (f) No identification numbers exist Where the appropriate identification numbers referred to in sub-paragraph (7)(a) to (e) do not exist in respect of any party, person, entity or property, the following words should be stated immediately below or after the name of that party, person, entity or property concerned: “(No ID No. exists)”. Inability to furnish identification number at the time of filing a document (8) If a party who wishes to file a document is unable at the time of filing to furnish the necessary identification numbers required by this Paragraph, the party may indicate “(ID Not Known)” at the time of filing. However, when the necessary identification numbers have been obtained, the party must furnish the necessary identification numbers to the Registry through the Electronic Filing Service. Meaning of document (9) For avoidance of doubt, the words “document” and “documents” when used in this Paragraph include all originating processes filed in the Family Justice Courts. Non-compliance (10) Any document which does not comply with this Paragraph may be rejected for filing by the Registry."

Key elements (5) To achieve the principles set out in paragraph (4), the parties and the parties’ lawyers may expect that each case commenced in the Family Justice Courts may be placed in different tracks bearing in mind the main issues of the case. Possible tracks assigned are; (a) Child track in which the main issues relate to custody, care and control and access (b) International track in which the main issues may involve abduction of a child, relocation issues and issues of appropriate jurisdiction (c) High conflict track in which the main issues are financial and the ascertainment of value and extent of the matrimonial assets amenable for division (d) Violence track in which the issue is one of physical and mental abuse. (6) A case may be assigned to one or more tracks. (7) Each case will be allocated to a Judge (assigned Judge) who is then responsible for managing the case until final disposition. (8) The assigned Judge will make orders about the way in which the case should be managed or prepared for hearing including referrals to mediation or other modes of alternative dispute resolution. (9) The parties and the parties’ lawyers may expect the assigned Judge to have regard to: (a) identifying and narrowing the issues in dispute as early as possible; (b) ascertaining the degree of difficulty or complexity of the issues determined to be in dispute; (c) setting a hearing date early; (d) minimising unnecessary interlocutory steps by permitting only interlocutory steps that are directed to identifying, narrowing or resolving the issues really in dispute between the parties; and (e) exploring options for alternative dispute resolution as early as practicable. (10) The parties and their lawyers are obliged to cooperate with, and assist, the Court in achieving the overarching purpose and, in particular, in identifying the real issues in dispute as early as possible and in dealing with those issues efficiently. Interlocutory applications (11) Where parties have included a claim for an interim relief, that claim may be heard on the return date fixed by the assigned Judge or a date for its later hearing may be set on the return date and directions for preparations made. (12) If a claim for interlocutory relief is to be contested, parties or their lawyers should advise the assigned Judge as soon as possible and to give an estimate of the likely hearing time. (13) Parties wishing to make urgent applications should contact the Court and to inform of urgency to be placed before the assigned Judge (14) If a claim is made for discovery/interrogatories, parties and lawyers should expect that, with a view to eliminating or reducing the burden of discovery, the assigned Judge: (a) will not order discovery as a matter of course, even where the parties consent, unless discovery is necessary for the determination of issues in the proceeding; (b) will fashion any order for discovery to suit the issues in a particular case; and (c) will expect the following questions to be answered: (i) Is discovery necessary to facilitate the just resolution of the proceeding as quickly, inexpensively and efficiently as possible? (ii) If discovery is necessary, for what purpose? (iii) Can those purposes be achieved — (A) by a means less expensive than discovery? (B) by discovery only in relation to particular issues? (iv) Where there are many documents, should discovery be given in a non- standard form, e.g. initially on a limited basis, with liberty to apply later for particular discovery or discovery on a broader basis? (v) Whether discovery should be given by the use of categories or by electronic format or in accordance with a discovery plan? (vi) Should discovery be given in the list of documents by categories and by a general description rather than by identification of individual documents? (15) In determining whether to make any order for discovery, the Court will have regard to the issues in the case and the order in which they are likely to be resolved, the resources and circumstances of the parties, the likely benefit of discovery and the likely cost of discovery and whether that cost is proportionate to the nature and complexity of the proceeding. Case conferences (16) Case conferences will as needed be set to monitor progress in preparation, resolve emerging procedural and other issues and to make any necessary directions or orders. Communications with Court (17) It is never appropriate to contact the assigned Judge directly. The assigned Judge will inform parties and their lawyers of preferred modes of communication but in all cases, the general approach is through emails to the generic email address of the Family Justice Courts. (18) All communications with Court should be confined to routine procedural, administrative or procedural matters. Communications should never, unless this is invited, contain information or allegations which are material to the substantive issues in the litigation or which are intended to influence any decision of substance to be made by the assigned Judge."

"text": "7. Guidance on Direct Judicial Communications in International Family Proceedings Affecting Children Explanatory Note Singapore society has become increasingly international. In cases involving children, a further complication arises where parents and children reside in more than one jurisdiction In such cases, direct judicial communications may be beneficial. This Practice Direction is issued to facilitate such communications. Direct judicial communications refer to communications that take place between sitting judges of different jurisdictions when there are concurrent related proceedings involving the same parties. It has now been recognised and firmly established in some foreign jurisdictions such as England &amp; Wales, Australia, New Zealand, Canada and United States of America that direct judicial communications are key mechanisms to assist practitioners and judges in resolving cases with an international element in the best interests of children and of justice in general. These communications will often result in considerable time savings and better use of available resources, and are done with the overriding objective of securing the best interests of the child. Direct judicial communication does not aim to inhibit parties’ right to adduce expert evidence on the foreign law, but should be seen as another tool to be made available for parties involved in multiple proceedings in different jurisdictions. Introduction (1) This Practice Direction is issued to assist judges and practitioners dealing with family proceedings affecting children in which direct judicial communications may be beneficial. It is not intended to change the current rules or procedure or to affect the substantive rights of the parties, but is simply intended to facilitate cooperation in international cases, where appropriate. (2) The Liaison Judges of Singapore are appointed by the Chief Justice, and it is part of their role to receive and, when necessary, channel incoming judicial communications and initiate or facilitate outgoing communications. The current appointees and further details of the Liaison Judges can be found on the Singapore Courts website at http://www.judiciary.gov.sg. (3) Matters which may be the subject of direct judicial communications include, for example: (a) scheduling the case in the foreign jurisdiction: (i) to make interim orders, eg, support, measure of protection; (ii) to ensure the availability of expedited hearings; (b) establishing whether protective measures are available for the child or other parent in the jurisdiction to which the child would be returned in the case of a child abduction case and, in an appropriate case, ensuring the available protective measures are in place in that jurisdiction before a return is ordered; (c) ascertaining whether the foreign court can accept and enforce undertakings offered by the parties in the initiating jurisdiction; (d) ascertaining whether the foreign court can issue a mirror order (ie, same order in both jurisdictions); (e) confirming whether orders were made by the foreign court; (f) verifying whether findings about domestic violence were made by the foreign court; (g) verifying whether a transfer of jurisdiction is appropriate. (4) “Central Authority” in this Practice Direction is the Authority appointed under section 5 of the International Child Abduction Act (Cap 143C). (5) For the avoidance of doubt, all references to “parties” or their “representatives” shall, where a child is to be separately represented, include the Child Representative as appointed by the Court under the Family Justice Rules. Overarching Principles (6) Every judge engaging in direct judicial communications must respect the law of his or her jurisdiction. (7) When communicating, each judge seised of the matter should maintain his or her independence in reaching his or her own decision on the matter at issue. (8) Communications must not compromise the independence of the judge seised in reaching his or her own decision on the matter at issue. Any discussion about the merits of the case should be avoided. (9) For the avoidance of doubt, parties remain entitled under the Family Justice Rules to call upon expert witnesses to prove or disprove the foreign law. The Court will take into account all the available evidence before arriving at a decision. Procedure and Safeguards (10) Either party to the proceeding may raise with the judge the desirability and need for direct judicial communications. (11) A judge seised of the matter may, if he or she determines it desirable, initiate direct judicial communication through the Liaison Judges. (12) Before deciding whether to engage in direct judicial communications, the judge should consider: (a) whether there is a question of foreign law or procedure to clarify with a judge in the foreign jurisdiction, (b) whether the question can be answered or dealt with by the Central Authority in Singapore or the Central Authority in the foreign jurisdiction, and if so, the judge may consider having the Central Authority address the issue or obtain the information, and (c) whether the question can be answered or dealt with by any judge in the foreign jurisdiction (other than the judge hearing the proceeding). (13) The following are commonly accepted procedural safeguards. (a) Except in special circumstances, parties are to be notified of the nature of the proposed communication; (b) A record is to be kept of communications and it is to be made available to the parties; (c) Any conclusions reached between the judges should be in writing and made available to parties; (d) Parties or their representatives should have the opportunity to be present in certain cases, for example via conference call facilities. (14) The above commonly accepted procedural safeguards should be adopted subject to Singapore’s legislation and rules. (15) In special or urgent circumstances where parties were not notified in advance of the nature of the proposed communications, the judge should provide written reasons to the parties as to why there was no notification as soon as practicable. (16) If any party objects to the proposed communications, the judge should direct submissions be lodged from all parties, and if necessary, should direct an oral hearing, before ruling on the matter, giving short reasons for such ruling. Initiating the Communication (17) In considering whether the use of direct judicial communications is appropriate, the judge should have regard to speed, efficiency and cost-effectiveness. (18) Judges should consider the benefit of direct judicial communications and at what stage of the proceeding it should occur. The timing of the communication is for the judge who initiates it to consider. (19) The initial communication should ordinarily take place between our Liaison Judge and the Liaison Judge of the other jurisdiction, if any, in order to ascertain the identity of the judge seised in that jurisdiction. If no Liaison Judge has been appointed in the other jurisdiction, the Central Authority of Singapore or the party within jurisdiction is to assist in providing the identity of the judge in the other jurisdiction. (20) When making contact with a judge in another jurisdiction, the initial communication should normally be in writing sent to the email address to FJC_FAMILY_REGISTRY@judiciary.gov.sg, subject to provisions set out in this Practice Direction in relation to written communications, and should in particular identify: (a) the name and contact details of the initiating judge; (b) the nature of the case (with due regard to confidentiality concerns); (c) the issue(s) on which communication is sought; (d) whether the parties before the judge initiating the communication have consented to judicial communication; (e) when the communication may occur (with due regard to time differences); (f) any specific questions which the judge initiating the communication would like answered; (g) any other pertinent matters. (21) The time and place for communications between the courts should be to the satisfaction of both courts. (22) Personnel other than judges in each court may communicate fully with each other to establish appropriate arrangements for the communication without the necessity for participation of counsel unless otherwise directed by either of the courts. The Form of Communications and Language Difficulties (23) Judges should use the most appropriate technological facilities in order to communicate as efficiently and as swiftly as possible. (24) The initial method and language of communication should, as far as possible, respect the preferences, if any, indicated by the intended recipient in the list of members of the Liaison Judges. Further communications should be carried out using the initial method and language of communication unless otherwise agreed by the judges concerned. (25) Where two judges do not understand a common language, and translation or interpretation services are required, such services could be provided by the court or the Central Authority in the country from which the communication is initiated. Written Communications (26) Written communications, particularly in initiating the contact, are valuable as they provide for a record of the communication and help alleviate language and time zone barriers. (27) Where the written communication is provided through translation, it is good practice also to provide the message in its original language. (28) Communications should always include the name, title and contact details of the sender. (29) Communications should be written in simple terms, taking into account the language skills of the recipient. (30) As far as possible, appropriate measures should be taken for the personal information of the parties to be kept confidential. (31) Written communications should be transmitted using the most rapid and efficient means of communication and, in those cases where it is necessary for confidential data to be transmitted, secured means of communication should be employed. (32) Written communications should always be acknowledged as soon as possible with an indication as to when a response will be provided. (33) All communications should be typewritten. (34) Ordinarily, communications should be in writing, save where the paragraph (35) applies. Oral Communications (35) Oral communications are encouraged where judges involved come from jurisdictions which share the same language. (36) Where the judges do not speak the same language, one or both of them, subject to an agreement between the two judges concerned, should have at their disposal a competent and neutral interpreter who can interpret to and from their language. (37) Where necessary, personal information concerning the parties should be anonymised for the purpose of oral communication. (38) Oral communications can take place by either telephone or video conference and in those cases where it is necessary that they deal with confidential information, such communications should be carried out using secured means of communication. (39) If both judges involved in the communication agree, the parties or their representative may be permitted to be present during the oral communication. If one party or representative is to be present, then the other party or representative should be permitted to be present. (40) Subject to the agreement of both judges involved in the oral communications- (a) such oral communications may be conducted in the presence of the parties or their representatives by way of video conference or by conference telephone call; (b) the parties or their representatives may be permitted to speak during the communication, but if one party or representative wishes to speak, then the other party or representative should be permitted a chance to answer. Post Communications (41) A written record of the communications should be sent to the parties as soon as practicable. (42) Any correspondence or email or written communications between the judges should be preserved for the record. Keeping Central Authority informed of judicial communications (43) Where appropriate, the judge engaged in direct judicial communications may consider informing his or her Central Authority that a judicial communication will take place."

"text": "11. Mediation and/or Counselling Directed by Court (1) In any proceedings before the Court, it may direct that parties attend mediation and/or counselling (pursuant to section 139H, 139I or 139J of the Women’s Charter (Cap. 353) or section 26(9) of the Family Justice Act 2014 (Act 27 of 2014)) to encourage parties to resolve the matter amicably and assist parties in reaching an agreement or to narrow the issues in contention. Sub-paragraphs (2) to (10) below apply to private mediations ordered by the Court, and sub-paragraphs (11) to (19) below apply to mediations and/or counselling conducted by the Court. (1A) It is the professional duty of advocates and solicitors to advise their clients about mediation. Mediation should be considered at the earliest possible stage in order to facilitate an amicable resolution of the dispute. Court Ordered Private Mediation (2) With effect from 1 January 2019, the Court will no longer conduct mediation in relation to proceedings (including divorce proceedings, applications pursuant to section 121B of the Women’s Charter (Cap. 353) and proceedings for a grant of probate or letters of administration in respect of the estate and effects of a deceased person) which meet the following criteria: (a) there is a contested issue relating to assets where the gross value of all known assets is S$2 million or above; and (b) there are no contested child issues (i.e. disputes relating to the custody, care and control of and/or access to any child). (2A) With effect from 1 July 2020, the Court will no longer conduct mediation where there is an application filed in the Family Justice Courts pursuant to the International Child Abduction Act (Cap. 143C). (3) The Registrar or the Judge may order that parties in proceedings which meet the criteria attend private mediation conducted, at parties’ election, by the Singapore Mediation Centre or the Law Society Mediation Scheme (collectively referred to as “Assigned Private Mediator(s)”), unless parties have agreed upon a mediator (“Agreed Private Mediator”). The Registrar or the Judge may also make any orders necessary, including any orders relating to the choice of mediator (if parties are unable to agree) and pertaining to the payment of the mediation and its related fees. (4) For mediations conducted by the Assigned Private Mediator(s), the parties and/or counsel shall provide the Registrar or the Judge with the necessary information for the Assigned Private Mediator(s) to contact them to arrange for the mediation. The Registrar or the Judge will give directions and timelines for parties to agree on a mediation date and to exchange case information, documents and mediation briefs. The Registrar or the Judge will fix a return date for parties and/or counsel to update the Court on the outcome of the private mediation. (5) For mediations conducted by the Agreed Private Mediators, the parties or their counsel shall inform the Registrar or the Judge of the identity of their Agreed Private Mediator, the management of the mediation and the agreed date for mediation. The Registrar or Judge may make any order necessary for the timely and efficacious disposal of the case, including fixing return dates for the parties or their counsel to update the court, and/or re-directing the case to the Assigned Private Mediator(s). (6) Parties and their counsel must personally attend all mediation sessions, unless otherwise stated by the private mediator. (7) For nullity, divorce and judicial separation proceedings in which interim judgment or judgment of judicial separation has been granted, if the dispute is resolved at private mediation, the parties and/or counsel may file the draft consent order for the Court’s approval in accordance with the requirements in Paragraph 116 of these Practice Directions. Alternatively, the parties may request to attend before the Court for the privately mediated agreement to be recorded as a consent order by the Registrar or the Judge upon confirmation of the terms by the parties and/or counsel. (8) Where interim judgment or judgment of judicial separation has not been granted, if the dispute is resolved at private mediation, the parties and/or counsel shall inform the Court accordingly on the return date given by the Registrar or the Judge pursuant to sub-paragraphs (4) or (5) above, as the case may be, and directions will be given for the setting down of the divorce on an uncontested basis on an expedited basis. (9) For all other proceedings not covered by sub-paragraphs (7) and (8) above, parties and/or counsel may either file the draft consent order in accordance with Paragraph 116 of these Practice Directions, or have it recorded as a consent order by the Registrar or the Judge upon the confirmation of the terms by the parties and/or counsel. (10) If the dispute is not resolved at the private mediation, the Registrar or the Judge will give the necessary directions at the return date to enable the case to proceed accordingly. Mediation conducted by the Court (11) For child-related proceedings, a Family Dispute Resolution Conference (“FDR Conference”) will be called to crystallise the issues of contention. All parties together with their counsel (if any) will have to attend the FDR Conference. At the FDR Conference, directions may be given in relation to the filing and exchanging of relevant documents and/or proposals. Parties will also be directed to attend mediation and/or counselling, whichever is appropriate. (12) For non-child related proceedings, the Registrar or the Judge may direct parties to attend mediation and/or counselling, whichever is appropriate. (13) Counsel is not expected to attend any counselling sessions directed by the Court. However, parties and counsel must personally attend all mediation sessions. (14) For all mediation sessions, (whether child-related or otherwise) the parties and their counsel are to prepare a Summary for Mediation in the prescribed format in Form 191 in Appendix A to these Practice Directions prior to the mediation for submission and discussion during the mediation, together with all relevant documents as may be directed by the Court. (15) Any consensus reached during counselling sessions will be recorded as a draft agreement. A copy of the draft will be given to the parties who are advised to consult their counsel (if any). (16) For nullity, divorce, judicial separation proceedings, where interim judgment or judgment of judicial separation has been granted, any agreement will be recorded as a consent order by the Judge-Mediator at a mediation session or any other Judge sitting as a Judge in Chambers upon confirmation of the terms by the parties and/or counsel. Where interim judgment or judgment of judicial separation has not been granted, the agreement will be formally recorded by the Judge and directions will be given for the setting down of the divorce on an uncontested basis on an expedited basis. (17) For all other proceedings not covered by sub-paragraph (16) above, any agreement reached will be recorded as a consent order by the Judge-Mediator at a mediation session or any other Judge sitting as a Judge in Chambers upon the confirmation of the terms by the parties and/or counsel.

"text": "12. Mandatory Counselling &amp; Mediation (1) Section 139I(2) of the Women’s Charter (Cap. 353) provides for mandatory counselling / mediation sessions at the Family Justice Courts. (2) Notice(s) of attendance for mandatory counselling/mediation sessions with location details will be sent to the plaintiff and defendant in the divorce proceedings. Attendance by the parties is compulsory. Attendance by the parties’ respective counsel, if any, is required only when specifically stated in the notification. (3) Counsel and parties are required to attend a Family Dispute Resolution Conference (“FDR Conference”) for a preliminary discussion of the issues relating to the child or children of the marriage. The purpose is to crystallise the issues on matters relating to the child or children and to agree on mutually convenient dates for the parties to attend counselling / mediation. Any unresolved issue relating to the divorce (including any ancillary issues such as the question of maintenance or the division of matrimonial assets) may also be discussed. (4) Counsel and parties are expected to come prepared to discuss all issues relating to or impacting the child or children. (5) After the FDR Conference, the parties alone will attend an Intake and Assessment Session with their assigned Family Counsellor. (6) Subsequent counselling sessions involving only the parties, may be fixed by the assigned Family Counsellor and the parties. (7) A Mediation date will be given to the parties and counsel at the FDR Conference if appropriate for the case. It is important that parties attend on the dates given and use the opportunity to discuss and resolve the issues with the help of a Judge-Mediator and/or Family Counsellor. Counsel and parties are to prepare a Summary for Mediation in Form 191 in Appendix A to these Practice Directions prior to the mediation for submission and discussion during the mediation together with all relevant documents as may be directed by the Court. (8) Any consensus reached during counselling sessions will be recorded as a draft agreement. A copy of the draft will be given to the parties who are advised to consult their counsel (if any). Where interim judgment has been granted, the agreement will be recorded as a consent order by the Judge-Mediator at a subsequent mediation session upon confirmation of the terms. (9) Where interim judgment or judgment for judicial separation has been granted, any agreement reached by the parties at any time may be recorded as a consent order by the Judge–Mediator at a mediation session or any other Judge sitting as a Judge in Chambers upon confirmation of the terms by the parties and/or counsel. Where interim judgment or judgment of judicial separation has not been granted, the agreement will be formally recorded by the Judge and directions will be given for the setting down of the divorce on an uncontested basis on an expedited basis. (10) Under section 139I(3) of the Women’s Charter (Cap. 353), the court may dispense with the attendance of the parties at mediation/counselling if it deems that it is not in the interest of the parties concerned to do so (e.g. where family violence has been committed or where Child Protection Services is involved in the case). (11) Counsel should advise his/her client of the consequences of non-compliance under section 139I(5) of the Women’s Charter (Cap. 353). (12) Mediation will be conducted on a without prejudice basis. All communications made in the course of mediation will be treated in strict confidence and will not be admissible in any court unless otherwise stipulated by law. If the dispute is not resolved at the mediation session, the District Judge or Registrar will give the necessary directions to enable the case to proceed to trial, and the case will be heard by a Judge other than the District Judge or Registrar conducting the mediation. (13) Where there is a disagreement between the parties on the terms of the agreement which were recorded at mediation, either party may write in to court for a clarification before the Judge-Mediator."

(2) Counselling is conducted to help parties manage difficult emotions related to a divorce or any other familial relationship, and facilitating a parenting agreement that preserves significant relationships and supports children’s psychological adjustment to the separation. Counselling may also be directed after orders are made to assist with the emotional aspects of dealing with the outcome of the orders particularly in cases involving the relocation of a child. (3) Counsel may attend a counselling session if the assigned counsellor considers it appropriate. (4) The counsellor may request that the child be included in the counselling sessions, either alone or together with the parents depending on the case, if the counsellor is of the view that it would be in the interest of the child to be involved. (5) Any request for a change or vacation of the counselling appointment shall be made at least 3 working days before the appointed date. (6) Counselling sessions will be conducted on a without prejudice basis. Any consensus reached during counselling sessions will be recorded as a draft agreement. A copy of the draft agreement, recorded by the counsellor and signed by the parties, will be given to the parties to seek further advice from their respective counsel (if any).

For matrimonial proceedings filed before 1 April 2006, any reference in this Paragraph to the plaintiff and defendant shall be read as a reference to the petitioner and respondent respectively. (2) To improve the conduct of contested matrimonial proceedings and to reduce the time taken in the presentation of cases in Court, the following documents shall be prepared by the respective solicitors of the parties: (a) a bundle of documents (an agreed bundle where possible); (b) a bundle of authorities; and (c) an opening statement. Bundle of documents (3) Documents to be used at trial should be consolidated into bundles paginated consecutively throughout at the top right hand corner. An index of contents of each bundle in the manner and form set out in Form 205 of Appendix A must also be furnished. No bundle of documents is necessary in cases where parties are not relying on any document at the trial. (4) It is the responsibility of solicitors for all parties to agree and prepare an agreed bundle as soon as possible. The scope to which the agreement extends must be stated in the index sheet of the agreed bundle. (5) In cases where certain documents cannot be agreed upon, these should be separately bundled as the plaintiff’s bundle, the defendant’s bundle or such other party’s bundle as the case may be. (6) The documents in the bundles should — (a) be firmly secured together with plastic ring binding or plastic spine thermal binding. The rings or spines should be red for plaintiffs and blue for defendants with a transparent plastic cover in front and at the back; (b) have flags to mark out documents to which repeated references will be made in the course of the hearing. Such flags shall bear the appropriate indicium by which the document is indicated in the index of contents. Flags shall be spaced out evenly along the right side of the bundle so that as far as possible they do not overlap one another; and (c) be legible. Clear legible photocopies of original documents may be exhibited instead of the originals provided the originals are made available for inspection by the other parties before the hearing and by the Judge at the hearing. (7) Where originals and copies of documents are included in one bundle, it should be stated in the index which documents are originals and which are copies. (8) Only documents which are relevant or necessary for the trial shall be included in the bundles. In cases where the Court is of the opinion that costs have been wasted by the inclusion of unnecessary documents, the Court will have no hesitation in making a special order for costs against the relevant person. (9) A core bundle should (unless clearly unnecessary) also be provided containing the most important documents upon which the case will turn or to which repeated reference will have to be made. The documents in this bundle should normally be paginated but should also be cross-referenced to copies of the documents included in the main bundles. The bundle supplied to the Court should be contained in a loose-leaf file which can easily have further documents added to it if required. (10) The bundles of documents including the agreed bundle and core bundle, if applicable, shall be filed and served on all relevant parties at least 3 days before trial. Bundle of authorities (11) The requirements set out in Paragraph 90(9) to (11) shall, with the necessary modifications, be complied with in respect of proceedings falling within this Paragraph.

(2) If the plaintiff or applicant falls or believes himself to fall within the categories of persons who do not require permission to file an application, this shall be stated in the supporting affidavit. Relevant documents, such as copies of birth certificates or marriage certificates, of the lasting powers of attorney or of the court orders appointing the deputies shall be exhibited to support the averment that no permission is required for an application under the Mental Capacity Act."

(2) In a situation where there are no named defendants, the application shall still be served on relevant persons. (3) Service on a named defendant shall be by way of personal service. Service on relevant persons may be by way of ordinary service pursuant to rule 902 of the Family Justice Rules, unless directed otherwise by the Court.

The grounds upon which the plaintiff or applicant is relying to obtain such permission must be stated clearly in the supporting affidavit. (5) Subject to the timelines specified under rule 179(2) of the Family Justice Rules, one affidavit of service may be filed in respect of service on all the named defendants and relevant persons in any application.

"documentTitle": "Family Justice Courts Practice Directions",
"url": "/Part%2011-Mental%20Capacity%20Act.html#50-relevant-persons",
"text": "50. Relevant persons (1) “Relevant persons” are persons who have an involvement in P’s life and/or who are likely to have an interest in the application. Often, P’s immediate family members, by virtue of their relationship to P, are likely to have an interest in being notified that an application has been made to the Court concerning P. (2) ‘Relevant persons’ for the purposes of Rule 176A and 179 of the Family Justice Rules will therefore often include the following immediate family members: (a) P’s spouse; (b) P’s children (aged 21 and above); (c) P’s parents or guardians; and (d) P’s brothers or sisters (aged 21 and above). (3) However, the presumption that immediate family members are likely to have an interest in an application concerning P may be rebutted where the plaintiff or applicant is aware of circumstances which reasonably indicate that P’s immediate family should not be served. For example, where the family member in question has had little or no involvement in P’s life and has shown no inclination to do so, that family member need not be served. In some cases, P may be closer to persons who are not immediate family members and if so, it will be appropriate to effect service on them instead of the immediate family members. (4) The plaintiff or applicant should serve the application, the supporting affidavits and the Notice to Relevant Person in Form 222 in Appendix A to these Practice Directions on relevant persons. (5) Where the plaintiff or applicant decides that a person listed in one of the categories in sub-paragraph (2) ought to be served, and there are other persons in that category (for example, P has three siblings), the plaintiff or applicant should serve on all persons falling within that category unless there is a good reason not to do so. For example, it may be a good reason not to serve on every person in the category if one or more of them has had little or no involvement in P’s life and has shown no inclination to do so. (6) Apart from immediate family members, other relevant persons who are likely to have an interest in the application concerning P and who should be served the application, the supporting affidavits and the Notice to Relevant Person in Form 222 in Appendix A to these Practice Directions include: (a) any other relatives or friends who have a close relationship with P; (b) any person who has a legal duty to support P; (c) any person who will benefit from P’s estate; and (d) any person who is responsible for P’s care. If there is no such person to the best of the plaintiff’s or applicant’s knowledge, he is to state this in his supporting affidavit. (7) The details of all relevant persons who should be served are to be listed clearly in the supporting affidavit of the plaintiff or applicant. Where service would not be effected on relevant persons who should be served, the reason why this is so must be stated in the supporting affidavit. (8) In cases where P has had severe intellectual disability since early childhood and where P’s parents are P’s sole caregivers and where P is now no longer a minor and P’s parents need to be authorised to continue to look after P’s affairs, P’s parents would normally be the only relevant persons for the purposes of the application but the applicants must provide sufficient information to enable the Court to reach the conclusion that there are no other relevant persons. (9) Organisations providing residential accommodation to P (a) If P resides at an organisation providing residential accommodation (regardless of whether it also provides care or treatment to P), the plaintiff or applicant shall serve the application, the supporting affidavits and the Notice to Relevant Person in Form 222 in Appendix A to these Practice Directions on such an organisation as soon as possible and in any event, not more than 2 working days after the application has been filed. For the purposes of the application, the organisation providing residential accommodation to P shall be considered a relevant person. However, the plaintiff or applicant need not obtain the consent of such an organisation to the application. (b) If the organisation providing residential accommodation to P wishes to furnish any relevant information for the Court’s consideration and determination of the application in the best interests of P, it shall notify the Court within 8 days after the date on which the organisation is served with the application. If such a notification is submitted, the Court may require and direct for the submission of a report and/or attendance of the maker of the report at the hearing of the application. (c) If an applicant has a strong reason for not serving an affidavit or any other document (other than the originating summons) on the organisation providing residential accommodation to P, the applicant may file a summons to seek dispensation of service of such documents on the organisation in question."

(2) The certificate of notification filed under rule 181(5) of the Family Justice Rules shall be in Form 223 in Appendix A to these Practice Directions. (3) Under the Mental Capacity Act, notification of P shall be the norm rather than the exception. However, in certain appropriate circumstances, the person required to notify P may apply to Court for an order to dispense with the requirement to notify P. Such an application would be appropriate where, for example, P is in a permanent vegetative state or a minimally conscious state, or where notification is likely to cause significant and disproportionate distress to P.

(3) For deaths occurring before 15 December 2003, the applicant must state in the Statement in Form 51, whether to the best of the applicant’s knowledge, there are any caveats or probate applications in respect of the deceased’s estate. The applicant is not required to state the position with respect to caveats and probate applications for deaths occurring on or after 15 December 2003.

(7) The original Will, original foreign grant or sealed certified true copy of the foreign grant (if any,) must be submitted to the Probate Counter by 4.30 p.m. of the next working day after the filing of the originating summons for verification. Where the original Will has been retained in the custody of a foreign court, a certified true copy of the Will by that foreign court must be filed and submitted for verification in place of the original. (8) The Probate Counter will return the original Will, original foreign grant or sealed certified true copy of the foreign grant to the applicant after verifying that the certified true copy of the document in the court file is an exact copy of the original document submitted. (9) When the Court is satisfied that the originating summons, Statement and the supporting documents have been properly filed and verified, a probate number will be issued in place of the provisional reference number. This probate number will be tied to the same electronic filing checklist. Rejection of documents (10) The Court may reject any document through the electronic filing checklist or through any other means if there are errors or if the document does not comply with the Family Justice Rules, the Practice Directions, or any other directions made by the Court."

Where such authorised process servers are no longer so authorised, solicitors are to revoke or delete the authorisation immediately by submitting a request through the Electronic Filing Service. Solicitors’ clerks do not require the authorisation of the Registrar to effect personal service of processes and documents. (3) In view of the alternative modes providing for personal service to be effected by a solicitor or a solicitor’s clerk, Court process servers will not be assigned to effect personal service of processes and documents unless there are special reasons. (4) If it is felt that there are special reasons requiring personal service by a Court process server, a Request for such service should be filed through the Electronic Filing Service, setting out the special reasons. The approval of the Duty Registrar should then be obtained for such service. Once approval has been obtained, the documents for service should be presented at the counter designated for this purpose. A process server will then be assigned to effect service and an appointment for service convenient to both the litigant and the assigned process server will be given. (5) On the appointed date, the person accompanying the process server should call at the Registry. The amount required for the transport charges of the process server (a record of which will be kept) should be tendered, or, alternatively, the process server in question should be informed that transport for him will be provided. The Registry will then instruct the process server to effect service. (6) Under no circumstances should any payment be made directly to the process server."

"text": "79. Substituted and Dispensation of Service (1) In any application for substituted service, the applicant should persuade the Court that the proposed mode of substituted service will bring the document in question to the notice of the person to be served. Application for substituted service by way of posting on the front door at the defendant’s last known address in Singapore (“the address”) (2) The applicant should, where appropriate, consider other modes of substituted service, such as AR registered post or electronic means (including electronic mail or Internet transmission) in addition to or in substitution of substituted service by posting on doors or gates of residential and business premises. (3) Two reasonable attempts at personal service should be made before an application for an order for substituted service is filed. In an application for substituted service, the applicant shall file a supporting affidavit stating the dates, times and outcomes of the said attempts and why he or she believes that such attempts made were reasonable. (4) If there is no response for both attempts at personal service (i.e. the door was locked and no one came to the door during both attempts), the plaintiff needs to state in the affidavit — (a) the evidence that the defendant is currently residing at the address (for example, relevant search results from the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore, the Singapore Land Authority, the Housing &amp; Development Board or the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority); and (b) the grounds for the plaintiff’s belief that the defendant is currently residing at the address, for example, that the plaintiff is also residing at the same address, and sees the defendant every day. (5) If the plaintiff is not able to state both of the matters set out in sub-paragraph (4)(a) and (b) above in the affidavit, he or she should make attempts to locate the defendant by contacting the defendant’s relatives, friends, and employer(s) (if any), in order to discover the address at which the defendant is currently residing. The affidavit should then include the following matters: (a) details of the plaintiff’s last contact with the defendant, including the date, the mode of contact (i.e. over the telephone, a letter, or a meeting), and the contents of any communications made, whether written or oral; (b) details of the plaintiff’s knowledge of the defendant’s relatives and friends, and those person(s)’ knowledge of his / her whereabouts (“the defendant’s contacts”), including their names, addresses and their relationship to the defendant and whether they live in Singapore or overseas; (c) details of the plaintiff’s attempts to contact the defendant’s contacts, including the number of such attempts made, the dates and mode of the said attempts (i.e. whether by telephone, letter, or meeting), and the contents of any communications made, whether written or oral; (d) the name and address of the defendant’s last known employer (if any), and the result of enquiries the plaintiff has made of that employer as to the defendant’s whereabouts, including the date of such enquiries, the mode of the said enquiries (i.e. whether by telephone, letter, or meeting), and the contents of any communications made, whether written or oral; (e) details of the defendant’s nationality. (6) If the local address at which the defendant is currently residing (not being the matrimonial home) is discovered by the plaintiff pursuant to paragraph (5) above, personal service on the defendant should be attempted at that address in accordance with paragraph (3). Details of the dates, times and outcomes of the personal service are required in the affidavit. (7) If the response to the attempt at personal service is that the process server is told that the defendant “is overseas”, evidence is required in the affidavit as to what date the defendant will be back in the country. (8) If it appears from the response to the attempt at personal service that the defendant is permanently overseas, evidence is required in the affidavit as to how the documents will come to the defendant’s attention by being posted on the front door. (9) If the response to the attempt at personal service is that the defendant has “moved away”, and the plaintiff is alleging that the defendant is evading service, evidence is required in the affidavit to support the plaintiff’s belief that the defendant is evading service. Application for substituted service by way of prepaid AR registered post / ordinary post (10) An application for substituted service need not be made where an originating process is sent by prepaid AR registered post to the defendant, and the defendant returns the acknowledgement of service, signed by him, in accordance with rule 48(5) and rule 49(3) of the Family Justice Rules. In such a situation, the originating process would be deemed to be duly served on the defendant by registered post. (11) On an application for substituted service by way of prepaid AR registered post / ordinary post, the plaintiff must state the following matters in the affidavit— (a) the grounds for the plaintiff’s belief that the defendant is currently resident at the particular address in respect of which the plaintiff is applying for substituted service by way of prepaid AR registered post / ordinary post; (b) if the application for substituted service by way of prepaid AR registered post / ordinary post is to an overseas address, that the defendant is not ordinarily resident in Singapore; (12) For the avoidance of doubt, substituted service by prepaid AR registered post is deemed to be effective when the postal service has delivered the document, or attempted to deliver the document (in cases where no one is present or willing to accept the document). Application for substituted service by way of email (13) If substituted service is by electronic mail, it has to be shown that the electronic mail account to which the document will be sent belongs to the person to be served and that it is currently active. Application for substituted service by way of advertisement (14) Before an application for substituted service by way of advertisement can be granted, the plaintiff should make attempts to locate the defendant by contacting the defendant’s relatives, friends, and employer(s) (if any), in order to discover the address at which the defendant is currently residing. (15) The affidavit must include the following: (a) the matters set out in sub-paragraph (5)(a) to (e) above; (b) details of the defendant’s literacy, and in what language; (c) if the advertisement is to be placed in an overseas newspaper, the grounds for the plaintiff’s belief as to why the defendant is thought to be in that particular country. (16) An application for substituted service by advertisement (in one issue of the Straits Times if the person to be served is literate in English, or one issue of the Straits Times and one issue of one of the main non-English language newspapers where his language literacy is unknown) should only be considered as a last resort and should contain evidence that the person to be served is literate in the language of the newspaper in which the advertisement will be placed. Application for dispensation of service (17) Before an application for dispensation of service can be granted, the plaintiff should make attempts to locate the defendant by contacting the defendant’s relatives, friends, and employer(s) (if any), in order to discover the address at which the defendant is currently residing. (18) The affidavit must include the following: (a) the matters set out in sub-paragraph (5)(a) to (e) above; (b) an explanation as to why advertisement would not be effective in bringing the divorce proceedings to the defendant’s notice (for example, that it is not known which country the defendant is currently residing in). (19) For the avoidance of doubt, posting on the Notice Board of the Registry of the Family Justice Courts is not available as a proposed mode of substituted service."

"title": "81. Applications for electronic discovery",
"documentTitle": "Family Justice Courts Practice Directions",
"url": "/Part%2013-General%20Procedure.html#81-applications-for-electronic-discovery",
"text": "81. Applications for electronic discovery (1) This Part provides an opt-in framework for requests and applications for the giving of discovery and inspection of electronically stored documents, and the supply of electronic copies of such documents. A party that seeks to rely on this Part must cite the relevant paragraph(s) in any request or application made hereunder. Location of electronically stored documents (2) Electronically stored documents may reside in storage management systems, folders or directories in storage locations, electronic media or recording devices, including folders or directories where temporarily deleted files are located (for example, the Recycle Bin folder or Trash folder). Electronically stored documents or parts thereof may also reside in the unallocated file space or file slack on an electronic medium or recording device as deleted files or file fragments which may be recovered through the use of computer forensic tools or techniques. Definition of metadata information (3) Metadata information refers to the non-visible and not readily apparent information embedded in or associated with electronically stored documents and may include both application metadata, which is created by the application software used to create the electronic documents, and system metadata, which is created by the operating or storage system. Examples of application metadata include hidden columns or text, formatting and display codes, formulae, prior edits and editorial comments; examples of system metadata include data relating to creation, modification and access of the electronic document, its size, file format and storage location, and other document profile information like title, author, subject and keywords or tags. Metadata information may be stored internally within the electronically stored document or externally in a separate file or database. Externally stored metadata information shall be discoverable as separate documents. Time to consider electronic discovery issues during general discovery (4) Parties are encouraged to collaborate in good faith and agree on issues relating to the discovery and inspection of electronically stored documents within the framework for discovery set forth in Part 18 Division 19 of the Family Justice Rules. Such issues may include the scope and/or any limits on documents to be given in discovery, whether parties are prepared to make voluntary disclosures, and the giving of discovery in stages according to an agreed schedule, as well as the format and manner in which copies of discoverable documents shall be supplied. (5) Parties may, immediately after the close of pleadings, agree on an electronic discovery protocol which may take the form set forth in Appendix B Part 1. Parties may include the agreed electronic discovery protocol in the summons for directions. The Court shall consider the adequacy of the agreed electronic discovery protocol and may make such order or give such direction as it thinks fit, for the just, expeditious and economical disposal of the cause or matter. The agreed electronic discovery protocol, as amended by such order or direction of the Court as the case may be, shall form part of the order under the summons for directions to be extracted for the action. (6) If parties are unable to agree on an electronic discovery protocol, the party seeking discovery of electronically stored documents may apply for an order. The application must include a draft electronic discovery protocol and must be supported by affidavit providing an account of the parties’ attempts to collaborate in good faith to reach agreement on an electronic discovery protocol. Requests for discovery (7) A request for discovery of any electronically stored document or class of electronically stored documents may be made before the commencement of proceedings, or at any time to any party to a cause or matter, or any person who is not a party to the proceedings. Unless the request specifies that discovery of externally stored metadata information of the requested electronically stored documents is required, the party providing discovery shall not be required to discover externally stored metadata information. (8) A class of electronically stored documents may be described by specifying or describing a search term or phrase to be used in a reasonable search for electronically stored documents. A request for the giving of discovery by reasonable search must specify or describe limits on the scope of the search; such limits shall include at least the following: (a) specifying or describing physical or logical storage locations, media or devices; and (b) specifying the period during which the requested electronically stored documents were created, received or modified. (9) A request shall not be made for the discovery of deleted files or file fragments containing information which may be recovered through the use of computer forensic tools or techniques unless: (a) a request is made for the discovery of the electronic medium or recording device on which a forensic inspection is to be conducted; and (b) a request is made for inspection of the said electronic medium or recording device in compliance with sub-paragraph (21) to (27). Applications for discovery (10) An application for discovery of any electronically stored document or class of electronically stored documents which includes externally stored metadata information must be supported by an affidavit showing that a request for externally stored metadata information of the requested electronically stored document or class of electronically stored documents had been made previously. (11) An application for discovery of any electronically stored document or class of electronically stored documents which specifies or describes a search term or phrase to be used in a reasonable search for electronically stored documents must specify or describe limits on the scope of the search to be conducted. (12) An application for the discovery of a computer database, electronic medium or recording device may be made together with an application for inspection of the said computer database, electronic medium or recording device in accordance with sub- paragraph (21) to (27). (13) Upon the hearing of an application for an order for discovery of electronically stored documents, the Court shall have regard to the matters set forth in sub-paragraph (15). (14) Nothing in this paragraph shall prevent the party giving discovery from reviewing the discoverable electronically stored documents or the results of any reasonable search for the purpose of identifying privileged documents. However, such review for the purpose of identifying privileged documents shall not extend to the deletion, removal or alteration of metadata information. Matters to which regard shall be had in determining whether discovery or inspection is necessary (15) Rules 468 and 474 of the Family Justice Rules states that an order for discovery and production of documents for inspection shall not be made unless such order is necessary either for disposing fairly of the cause or matter or for saving costs. The matters to which regard shall be had, in determining whether an application for discovery or inspection (including the supply of copies) of electronically stored documents is necessary either for disposing fairly of the cause or matter or for saving costs, shall include: (a) the number of electronic documents involved; (b) the nature of the case and complexity of the issues; (c) the value of the claim and the financial position of each party; (d) the ease and expense of retrieval of any particular electronically stored document or class of electronically stored documents, including — (i) the accessibility, location and likelihood of locating any relevant documents, (ii) the costs of recovering and giving discovery and inspection of any relevant documents, (iii) the likelihood that any relevant documents will be materially altered in the course of recovery, or the giving of discovery or inspection; and (e) the significance of any particular electronically stored document or class of electronically stored documents which are likely to be located to the issues in dispute. Form of list (16) The following matters shall be included in any list of documents made pursuant to the giving of discovery in accordance with this Part in which electronic documents are enumerated: (a) the name of the electronic file constituting or containing the electronic document; and (b) the file format (and its version) of the electronic document. (17) Where the party giving discovery objects to the production of certain discoverable electronically stored documents solely on the ground that the internally stored metadata information is protected by privilege, he must state in the list of documents whether he objects to the production of the electronic documents without the internally stored metadata information. If he does not object to the production of the electronic documents without the internally stored metadata information, he must enumerate the electronic documents in Part 1 of Schedule 1 to the list of documents. In any event, he must enumerate such documents in a separate section in Part 2 of Schedule 1 to the list of documents and shall state that he objects to the production of the whole or part of the internally stored metadata information of these documents. (18) Reasonable efforts shall be made to remove duplicated documents from the list of documents. A document shall be considered a duplicate of another if the contents of both (including metadata information) are identical. The use of a hashing function to identify duplicates shall be deemed to be reasonable effort. (19) If copies of electronic documents are supplied in one or more read-only optical disc(s) or other storage medium, the party giving discovery shall provide a further list, at the time when such copies are supplied, stating the following: (a) the storage format (and its version) of the optical disc or storage medium; and (b) if there are multiple optical discs or storage media, a list of electronic documents stored on each optical disc or storage medium. (20) An index of documents enumerated in a list of documents referred to in sub-paragraph (16) or (19) above shall be provided in an electronic, text searchable and structured format. In the absence of parties’ agreement, this index or load file shall be provided in a delimited text file in the Comma Separated Value (or ‘CSV’) file format. Inspection of electronically stored documents (21) A party required to produce electronically stored documents for inspection under Part 18 Division 19 of the Family Justice Rules shall provide reasonable means and assistance for the party entitled to inspection to inspect the electronically stored documents in their native format. (22) Where an inspection is carried out under rule 470, 471 or 472(1) of the Family Justice Rules and the inspecting party wishes to take copies of electronically stored documents produced for inspection, his request to take copies shall comply with the protocol set forth in sub-paragraphs (28) to (33). Inspection of computer databases and electronic media or recording devices (23) No request or application for the inspection of any computer database, electronic medium or recording device shall be made unless discovery of the computer database, electronic medium or recording device has been given. (24) A request may be made for the inspection of an electronic medium or recording device (for which discovery has been given) for the purpose of recovering deleted electronic documents through the conduct of a forensic examination of the unallocated file space or file slack of the electronic medium or recording device using computer forensic tools or techniques. (25) Where an application under rule 472(2) is made for the inspection of computer databases, electronic media or recording devices for which discovery has been given, the party seeking inspection shall include in his application an inspection protocol, which may take the form found in Appendix B Part 2, in order to ensure that the party entitled to inspection has access only to electronic documents that are necessary and is not allowed to trawl through the entire database, electronic media or recording device. (26) Upon the hearing of an application for an order for the inspection of computer databases, electronic media or recording devices, the Court shall have regard to the matters set forth in sub-paragraph (15). The Court shall have the power to review the adequacy of an inspection protocol and may make such order or give such direction as it thinks fit, for the just, expeditious and economical disposal of the cause or matter. (27) Nothing in this paragraph shall prevent the party producing computer databases, electronic media or recording devices for inspection from reviewing the discoverable electronically stored documents or the results of any reasonable search for the purpose of identifying privileged documents. However, such review for the purpose of identifying privileged documents shall not extend to the deletion, removal or alteration of metadata information. Supply of copies of electronically stored documents (28) Copies of discoverable electronically stored documents shall generally be supplied in the native format in which the requested electronic documents are ordinarily maintained and in one or more read-only optical disc(s). (29) Metadata information internally stored in the native format of discoverable electronically stored documents shall not be deleted, removed or altered without the agreement of the parties or an order of Court. Where the party giving discovery objects to the production for inspection of certain discoverable electronically stored documents solely on the ground that the internally stored metadata information is protected by privilege, but does not object to the production of the electronic documents without the internally stored metadata information, copies of such documents may be supplied in a reasonably usable format with all or such of the metadata information over which privilege is claimed removed. Requests for the supply of copies (30) A request for copies of discoverable electronically stored documents may specify the format and manner in which such copies are to be supplied. If the party giving discovery does not agree with the specified format or manner or both, he may either: (a) propose a reasonably usable format and/or storage medium and/or a reasonable manner in which he intends to supply copies of the requested electronic documents; or (b) in default of agreement, supply copies of the requested electronic documents in accordance with sub-paragraph (1). (31) The party giving discovery shall not be required to supply copies of electronically stored documents in more than one format. (32) The file format versions set forth in Appendix B Part 3 shall be deemed to be reasonably usable formats for the purpose of this paragraph. Applications for the supply of copies (33) Applications for the supply of copies of discoverable electronically stored documents shall specify the format and manner in which copies of such electronic documents are to be supplied. Restriction on use of privileged document, inspection of which has been inadvertently allowed (34) Rule 479 of the Family Justice Rules applies to the giving of discovery or inspection of electronically stored documents, including the supply of copies, as it would to the giving of discovery or inspection of any other document. Costs (35) Except for orders made in respect of third party or pre-action discovery, the costs of complying with an order for the giving of discovery or inspection of electronically stored documents shall generally be borne by the party giving discovery; and disbursements incurred in providing copies shall be reimbursed by the party requesting for copies. (36) The Court may invoke its inherent powers under rules 958 and 959 of the Family Justice Rules to make or give such further orders or directions incidental or consequential to any order as may be necessary, to order the party entitled to discovery to bear the whole or a portion of the costs of compliance with such order for the giving of discovery or inspection of electronically stored documents, and the supply of copies, if such order is necessary to prevent injustice or to prevent an abuse of the process of the Court."

"text": "83. Ex parte applications for injunctions (1) Rule 516 of the Family Justice Rules provides that an application for the grant of an injunction may be made ex parte in cases of urgency. However, the cases of Castle Fitness Consultancy Pte Ltd v Manz [1989] SLR 896 ‘ The Nagasaki Spirit ’ (No.1) [1994] 1 SLR 434 take the position that an opponent to an ex parte application, especially where the application seeks injunctive relief, should be invited to attend at the hearing of the application. (2) In view of this, any party applying ex parte for an injunction (including a Mareva injunction) must give notice of the application to the other concerned parties prior to the hearing. The notice may be given by way of facsimile transmission or the use of any other electronic means (including electronic mail or Internet transmission), or, in cases of extreme urgency, orally by telephone. Except in cases of extreme urgency or with the leave of the Court, the party shall give a minimum of two hours’ notice to the other parties before the hearing. The notice should inform the other parties of the date, time and place fixed for the hearing of the application and of the nature of the relief sought. If possible, a copy of the originating process, the ex parte summons and supporting affidavit(s) should be given to each of the other parties in draft form as soon as they are ready to be filed in Court. At the hearing of the ex parte application, in the event that some or all of the other parties are not present or represented, the applicant’s solicitors should inform the Court of: (a) the attempts that were made to notify the other parties or their solicitors of the making of the application; (b) what documents were given to the other parties or their solicitors and when these documents were given; and (c) whether the other parties or their solicitors consent to the application being heard without their presence. (3) The Directions set out in sub-paragraph (2) need not be followed if the giving of the notice to the other parties, or some of them, would or might defeat the purpose of the ex parte application. However, in such cases, the reasons for not following the Directions should be clearly set out in the affidavit prepared in support of the ex parte application."

Mareva injunctions (1) Applicants for Mareva injunctions are required to prepare their orders in accordance with the following forms in Appendix A: (a) Form 239: Worldwide Mareva injunction; and (b) Form 240: Mareva injunction limited to assets within the jurisdiction. When composing the summons electronic form online through the Electronic Filing Service, these Forms shall be prepared in Portable Document Format (PDF) and attached to the summons electronic form for an Order of Court in Form 4 or 118 of Appendix A to these Practice Directions. (2) These forms, inevitably, are complicated, but their language and layout are intended to make it easier for persons served with these orders to understand what they mean. These standard form orders should be used save to the extent that the Judge hearing a particular application considers there is a good reason for adopting a different form. Any departure from the terms of the prescribed forms should be justified by the applicant in his supporting affidavit(s). (3) The applicant should undertake not to inform any third party of the proceedings until after the return date. (4) Wherever practicable, applications should be made sufficiently early so as to ensure that the Judge has sufficient time to read and consider the application in advance. (5) On an ex parte application for a Mareva injunction, an applicant may be required, in an appropriate case, to support his cross-undertaking in damages by a payment to be made into Court, a bond to be issued by an insurance company with a place of business within Singapore, a written guarantee to be issued from a bank with a place of business within Singapore or a payment to the applicant’s solicitor to be held by the solicitor as an officer of the Court pending further order."

"text": "87. Attendance at hearings in the Family Justice Courts (1) For the avoidance of doubt, the general rule is that all hearings in a Family Justice Court shall be heard in private pursuant to section 10(1) of the Family Justice Act. Members of the public are not entitled to attend such hearings. (2) Notwithstanding paragraph (1) above, a Family Justice Court may hear any matter in an open and public court to which the public generally may have access, if the Court is satisfied that it is expedient in the interests of justice, or for other sufficient reason to do so. Such matters include but are not limited to:- (a) trial or hearings for proceedings under section 105 and 106 of the Women’s Charter; (b) uncontested trials or hearings for proceedings under section 95 and 101 of the Women’s Charter which were adjourned from chambers to Open Court; and (c) mentions for proceedings under Part VII and VIII of the Women’s Charter. (3) Subject to any written law, the Court may, in its discretion, permit interested persons, such as instructing solicitors, and parties to the matter, to attend hearings in a Family Justice Court. In exercising its discretion, the Court may consider a broad range of factors including — (a) the interest that the person seeking permission has in the matter before the Court; (b) the interests of the litigants; (c) the reasons for which such permission is sought; and (d) the Court’s interest in preserving and upholding its authority and dignity. (4) In granting interested persons the permission to attend hearings in a Family Justice Court, the Court may, in its discretion, impose the necessary conditions to be complied with."

"text": "88. Electronic filing of documents and authorities for use in Court generally Time for filing of documents (1) Subject to any Directions in this Part to the contrary, or by the Court to the contrary, all documents to be used at any hearing in Court must be filed using the Electronic Filing Service at least 1 clear day in advance of the hearing. These documents include written submissions, skeletal arguments, bundles of documents, bundle of pleadings, bundles of affidavits, core bundles and opening statements. (2) In the event that it is not possible to file the documents in advance of the hearing, counsel may apply to the Judge or Registrar conducting the hearing for leave to: (a) use hard copy documents during the hearing. Without limiting paragraph 90(12) of these Practice Directions, the hard copy documents may be printed on one side or both sides of each page; or (b) display a soft copy of the document by sharing his or her screen during the hearing (if the hearing is conducted by video-conferencing). The solicitor must explain why it was not possible to file the documents in advance of the hearing, and must also give an undertaking to file using the Electronic Filing Service all the documents used at the hearing by the next working day after the hearing. Any document not filed using the Electronic Filing Service will not be included in the Court’s case file. General requirements as regards documents filed for use in Court (3) Without limiting any directions in these Practice Directions, the following requirements apply to all documents filed for use in Court: (a) Cover pages are mandatory for all documents; (b) A table of contents is mandatory for all documents exceeding 20 pages; (c) Where a document consists of more than 1 volume: (i) the table of contents of all volumes of the document must be placed at the beginning of Volume I; and (ii) each volume must have a table of contents indicating the items that are contained in that volume. (4) If the filing of a document is to be done by submitting only a hard copy of the same to the Registry in accordance with these Practice Directions or the Court’s direction: (a) Any fees payable pursuant to the Fifth Schedule to the Family Justice Rules must be paid over the counter or by any alternative mode of payment specified by the Registry at the same time as when the hard copy document is submitted to the Registry. (b) Parties should, when making payment over the counter, indicate to the cashier the precise number of pages which comprise the documents. (c) The hard copy of the document filed in Court should show, on the first page of the document, the amount of fees that have been paid on the document. (d) To avoid doubt, this sub-paragraph does not apply where: (i) a document is filed, and the fees payable pursuant to the Fifth Schedule to the Family Justice Rules are paid, through the Electronic Filing System; and (ii) the party chooses to tender hard copy of the document to the Registry. Bundle of authorities (5) Where bundles of authorities are required to be filed under these Practice Directions or by the Court, the following directions, unless otherwise provided by these Practice Directions or ordered by the Court, apply. (6) Bundles of authorities may be filed, served, delivered or otherwise conveyed using the Electronic Filing Service. A party may also choose not to file the bundle of authorities into the electronic case file and instead submit a hard copy of the bundle of authorities for hearings according to the directions in this Part. (7) The party using the hard copy of the bundle of authorities must produce the bundle at every hearing at which it is required. The hard copy of the bundle of authorities may be printed on one side or both sides of each page. The Court will neither retain nor undertake to produce for hearings the hard copy of the bundle. The Judge or Registrar may, if he or she so chooses, retain the hard copy of the bundle of authorities for his or her own reference. The hard copy so retained will not, however, form part of the Court’s record in respect of the proceedings in which it was used. (8) Counsel must adhere to the following directions when preparing bundles of authorities for use in Court. These requirements also apply to paragraphs 90 to 92, 99, 125 and 126 of these Practice Directions: (a) The bundle of authorities must contain all the authorities, cases, statutes, subsidiary legislation and any other materials relied on. (b) The bundle of authorities must be arranged in the following order – statutes in alphabetical order of the title, subsidiary legislation in alphabetical order of the title, cases in alphabetical order of the case name, secondary materials (such as textbooks and articles) in alphabetical order of the last name of the author, and any other materials in alphabetical order of the title or last name of the author as is appropriate. (c) The bundle of authorities must have a table of contents immediately after the cover page. Where the bundle of authorities consists of more than 1 volume: (i) the table of contents of all volumes of the bundle of authorities must be placed at the beginning of Volume I; and (ii) each volume must have a table of contents indicating the authorities that are contained in that volume. (d) The items in the table of contents must be numbered sequentially, and bound in the order in which they are listed. (e) The table of contents must contain a concise statement of the relevance of each authority to the specific issues before the Court. The relevance of each authority must be succinctly expressed and comprise no more than 3 sentences. The statement must be set out immediately after the name of the case. For example: Rickshaw Investments Ltd and another v Nicolai Baron von Uexkull [2007] 1 SLR(R) 377 Relevance: Choice of law considerations are relevant even when determining the natural forum to hear a dispute. (f) The bundle of authorities must be properly bound with plastic ring binding or plastic spine thermal binding. The rings or spines should be red for plaintiffs/appellants and blue for defendants/respondents with a transparent plastic cover in front and at the back. (g) The bundle of authorities must have flags to mark out the authorities. Such flags must bear the appropriate indicium by which the authority is referred to. Flags must be spaced out evenly along the right side of the bundle so that as far as possible they do not overlap one another. (h) The bundle of authorities must be paginated consecutively at the top right hand corner of each page. Each separate volume must start at page 1, and every page in that volume must be numbered consecutively. (i) The bundle of authorities must be legible. Clear copies of the authorities must be made available for inspection by the other parties or the Judge if the copies exhibited in the bundle of authorities are not legible. (9) The Court may reject bundles of authorities that are not in compliance with sub-paragraph (8) above, and in exercising its discretion as to costs, take such non-compliance into account. (10) Only authorities which are relevant or necessary for the trial or hearing may be included in the bundle. No bundle of authorities is necessary in cases where parties are not relying on any authority at the trial or hearing. In cases where the Court is of the opinion that costs have been wasted by the inclusion of unnecessary authorities, the Court will have no hesitation in making a special order for costs against the relevant party. (11) Where bundles of authorities are filed through the Electronic Filing Service, the following applies: (a) A bookmark should be created in the Portable Document Format (PDF) file for each authority in the bundle. (b) The name given to each bookmark should be the same as the corresponding authority in the table of contents. (c) The page number of each printed volume of the bundle must correspond to the page number in the Portable Document Format (PDF) version of that volume of the bundle. Each separate volume must start at page 1, and every page in that volume must be numbered consecutively."

"text": "90. Documents for use in trials (1) This Paragraph shall apply to trials of — (a) writ actions; and (b) originating summonses ordered to be continued as if the cause of action had been begun by writ. (2) To improve the conduct of family proceedings and to reduce the time taken in the presentation of cases in Court, the following documents shall also be prepared by the respective solicitors of the parties: (a) a bundle of authorities; and (b) an opening statement. Time for filing of documents under rule 567(1) of the Family Justice Rules (3) Parties are to note that the timeline given pursuant to the Court’s directions under rule 567(1) of the Family Justice Rules is to be adhered to strictly, and that the timeline will apply to the filing of the documents into the electronic case file and, if applicable, the submission of the CD-ROM or DVD-ROM (containing the documents in Portable Document Format (PDF)) to the Registry. (4) At the trial of the cause or matter, an adjournment may be ordered if: (a) the documents or any of them (save for the opening statement in cases where it is not required or dispensation was granted) were not filed and served within the prescribed time or at all; or (b) one party seeks to tender any of the above documents or supplements to such documents (except for supplements to the opening statement at the trial of the cause or matter). (5) If an adjournment is ordered for any of the reasons set out in sub-paragraph (3), the party in default may be ordered to bear the costs of the adjournment. Mode of filing documents (6) The opening statement, the affidavits of the evidence-in-chief of all witnesses or other affidavits, and the bundle of documents must be filed in Court as separate documents using the Electronic Filing Service, and, if required, each of the opening statement, the affidavits of the evidence-in-chief of all witnesses or other affidavits, and the bundle of documents in Portable Document Format (PDF) stored on optical media (CD-ROM or DVD-ROM) may be tendered to the Registry. The documents must comply with the provisions of this paragraph. (7) Additionally, unless otherwise directed, the parties must tender the documents referred to at sub-paragraph (6) above to the Registry in hard copy. The hard copy must tally in all respects with the soft copy (if tendered in optical media), and the page numbers of the hard copy must correspond to the page numbers in the Portable Document Format (PDF) version. Parties should adhere as far as possible to the guidelines set out on the eLitigation website at http://www.elitigation.sg on the resolution to be used when scanning documents into PDF. Bundle of documents (8) The bundles of documents in Rules 566 and 567(1)(b) must be prepared in an electronic format. The contents of the bundle of documents must be agreed on between all parties as far as possible. If there are other documents, the relevance of which is uncertain, these documents should be included and any objections taken before the trial Judge. Only documents which are relevant or necessary for the trial may be included in the bundles. In cases where the Court is of the opinion that costs have been wasted by the inclusion of unnecessary documents, the Court will have no hesitation in making a special order for costs against the relevant party. No bundle of documents is necessary in cases where parties are not relying on any document at the trial. (9) The following directions apply to the electronic creation of bundles of documents: (a) Index pages shall be prepared. Bookmarks should be created in the Portable Document Format (PDF) file for each such reference in the index. There should be as many book-marks in that PDF file as there are references in the index to documents in that PDF file. (b) The name given to each bookmark should be the same as the corresponding reference in the index. (c) It is the responsibility of the solicitors for all parties to agree and prepare a bundle of agreed documents. The scope to which the agreement extends must be stated in the index sheet of the bundle of agreed documents. If the parties are unable to agree on the inclusion of certain documents, those documents on which agreement cannot be reached must be prepared by the party that intends to rely on or refer to those documents. It is the responsibility of the solicitors for the party filing the bundle of documents to separate the documents into sections for documents of which authenticity is not in dispute and documents of which authenticity is in dispute and to indicate in the index sheet the documents of which authenticity is in dispute and by whom. Apart from the above, the various PDF documents should be arranged chronologically or in some logical order. (d) The page number of each bundle of documents must correspond to the page number in the Portable Document Format (PDF) version of that bundle. Each separate bundle of documents shall start at page 1 and every page shall be numbered consecutively. (10) For proceedings using the Electronic Filing Service, a bundle of documents may be created online and filed through the Electronic Filing Service. The electronic bundle shall be created in Portable Document Format (PDF). The electronic bundle may contain: (a) documents in the electronic case file; and (b) documents that have been uploaded into the electronic case file by solicitors or other persons given access to the shared folder in the electronic case file. (11) The directions in sub-paragraph (12) below apply to hard copies tendered to the Registry or the Court. (12) The documents in the bundles should — (a) contain an index of contents of each bundle in the manner and form set out in Form 205 in Appendix A to these Practice Directions. (b) be paginated consecutively throughout at the top right hand corner and may be printed on one side or both sides of each page. (c) Where the bundle of documents consists of more than 1 volume: (i) the index of contents of all volumes of the bundle of documents must be placed at the beginning of Volume 1; and (ii) each volume must have an index of contents indicating the documents that are contained in that volume. (d) be firmly secured together with plastic ring binding or plastic spine thermal binding, and such rings or spines should be red for plaintiffs and blue for defendants with a transparent plastic cover in front and at the back; (e) have flags to mark out documents to which repeated references will be made in the course of hearing, and such flags shall — (i) bear the appropriate indicium by which the document is indicated in the index of contents; and (ii) be spaced out evenly along the right side of the bundle so that as far as possible they do not overlap one another; and (f) be legible (for which purpose clear legible photo-copies of original documents may be exhibited instead of the originals provided the originals are made available for inspection by the other parties before the hearing and by the Judge at the hearing). (g) Where originals and copies of documents are included in one bundle, it should be stated in the index which documents are originals and which are copies. Core bundle of documents (13) A core bundle should (unless clearly unnecessary) also be provided containing the most important documents upon which the case will turn or to which repeated reference will have to be made. The documents in this bundle should normally be paginated but should also be cross-referenced to copies of the documents included in the main bundles. The bundle supplied to the Court should be contained in a loose-leaf file which can easily have further documents added to it if required. (13) Where the core bundle of documents consists of more than 1 volume: (a) the table of contents of all volumes of the core bundle of documents must be placed at the beginning of Volume I; and (b) each volume must have a table of contents indicating the documents that are contained in that volume. Opening statements (15) A proper opening statement is of great assistance to the Court as it sets out the case in a nutshell, both as to facts and law. It is intended to identify both for the parties and the Judge the issues that are, and are not, in dispute. It enables the Judge to appreciate what the case is about, and what he is to look out for when reading and listening to the evidence that will follow. Opening statements also help to clarify issues between the parties, so that unnecessary time is not spent on trying to prove what is not disputed or irrelevant. The need for brevity is emphasised as opening statements that contain long and elaborate arguments, and citations from and references to numerous authorities, do not serve this purpose. (a) In the light of these objectives, opening statements will be required in all cases from all parties, except where dispensation has been granted by the trial Judge and in running down actions. (b) All opening statements must include the following: (i) the nature of the case generally and the background facts insofar as they are relevant to the matter before the Court and indicating which facts, if any, are agreed; (ii) the precise legal and factual issues involved are to be identified with cross-references as appropriate to the pleadings. These issues should be numbered and listed, and each point should be stated in no more than one or two sentences. The object here is to identify the issues in dispute and state each party’s position clearly, not to argue or elaborate on them; (iii) the principal authorities in support of each legal proposition should be listed, while the key documents and witnesses supporting each factual proposition should be identified; (iv) where there is a counterclaim or third party action, the opening statement must similarly address all issues raised therein; and (v) an explanation of the reliefs claimed (if these are unusual or complicated). (c) In the case of the plaintiff, the statement must include the following: (i) a summary of essential facts indicating which, if any, are agreed; (ii) an indication of how these facts are to be proved, identifying relevant witnesses and documents; (d) The plaintiff’s statement as provided for in sub-paragraph (15)(c) above, should, unless exempted or dispensation has been granted by the trial Judge, be filed and served on all other relevant parties not less than 3 working days before the commencement of the trial for which they are to be used. (e) The other counsel should each similarly not later than 2 working days before the start of the trial provide to the Court (with copies at the same time to their opponents) a statement which should concisely state the nature of their case on each of the issues to be tried and summarise the propositions of law to be advanced with references to the main authorities to be relied on. The character and length of this document will depend on the circumstances and whether there is any counterclaim or third-party proceedings. (f) In cases where the Court is of the opinion that costs or hearing days have been wasted by a poorly drafted opening statement, the Court will have no hesitation in making a special order for costs against the relevant person. (g) The following format shall be adhered to when preparing opening statements: (i) all pages shall be paginated, with the first page (including the cover page) numbered as ‘Page 1’ so that the page numbers of the hard copy correspond to the page numbers in the Portable Document Format (PDF) version; (ii) the minimum font size to be used is Times New Roman 12 or its equivalent; (iii) the print of every page shall be double spaced; (iv) each page may be printed on one side or both sides; and (v) every page shall have a margin on all 4 sides, each of at least 35 mm in width. (h) All opening statements should not exceed 20 pages (including the cover page, table of contents and all annexes and appendices). All opening statements must include a cover page and a table of contents. (i) Opening statements may be amended at trial, but counsel will be expected to explain the reasons for the amendments. Bundle of authorities (16) In addition to the documents required to be filed and served under rule 567 of the Family Justice Rules, the Court may direct parties to file and serve bundles of authorities. Paragraphs 88(5) to (11) of these Practice Directions must be complied with. (17) The bundle of authorities shall be filed and served on all relevant parties at least 5 working days before trial."

"text": "93. Citation of written judgments (1) Counsel who wish to cite a judgment as authority in support of their oral or written submissions must adhere to the following directions. These directions are intended to provide guidance to advocates and solicitors as to: (a) the extent to which it is necessary to rely on local and foreign judgments in support of their case; and (b) the practice of citing such judgments. Use of judgments as authorities in submissions (2) Counsel who cite a judgment must state the proposition of law that the judgment establishes and the parts of the judgment that support that proposition. Such statements should not excessively add to the length of the submission but should be sufficient to demonstrate the relevance of that judgment to the argument made. Where counsel wish to cite more than two judgments as authority for a given proposition, there must be a compelling reason to do so, and this reason must be provided by counsel in submissions. (3) The Court will also pay particular attention to any indication in the cited judgment that the judgment: (a) only applied decided law to the facts of the particular case; or (b) did not extend or add to the existing law. Use of judgments from foreign jurisdictions (4) Judgments from other jurisdictions can, if judiciously used, provide valuable assistance to the Court. However, where there are in existence local judgments which are directly relevant to the issue, such judgments should be cited in precedence to foreign judgments. Relevant local judgments will be accorded greater weight than judgments from foreign jurisdictions. This will ensure that the Courts are not unnecessarily burdened with judgments made in jurisdictions with differing legal, social or economic contexts. In addition, counsel who cite a foreign judgment must: (a) draw the attention of the Court to any local judgment that may be relevant to whether the Court should accept the proposition that the foreign judgment is said to establish; and (b) ensure that such citation will be of assistance to the development of local jurisprudence on the particular issue in question. Citation practice (5) Counsel who cite a judgment must use the official series of the law report(s) or, if the official series is not available, any other law report series in which the judgment was published. Counsel should refrain from referring to (or including in the bundle of authorities) copies of judgments which are printed out from electronic databases, unless: (a) such judgments are not available in any law report series; or (b) the print-outs are the exact copies of the judgments in the law report series. The following are examples of law reports that should be used for citation: Jurisdiction Law Reports (in order of preference) (a) Singapore 1. Singapore Law Reports (2010 - ) (SLR current series) 2. Singapore Law Reports (Reissue) (SLR (R)) 3. Singapore Law Reports (1965-2009) (SLR 1965-2009) 4. Malayan Law Journal (MLJ) (b) Malaysia Malayan Law Journal (MLJ) (c) England &amp; Wales 1. Law reports published by the Incorporated Council of Law Report (e.g., Queen’s Bench (QB), Appeal Cases (AC), Chancery (Ch), Family (Fam), Probate (P) 2. Weekly Law Reports (WLR) 3. All England Law (All ER) (d) Australia 1. Commonwealth Law Reports (CLR) 2. Australian Law Reports (ALR) (e) Canada 1. Supreme Court Reports (SCR)) 2. Federal Court Reports (FC) 3. Dominion Law Reports (DLR) (f) New Zealand New Zealand Law Reports (NZLR) (6) Counsel should, where possible, make specific citations by referring to the paragraph number of the judgment, and not to the page number of the judgment or report. For consistency, square brackets ([xx]) should be used to denote paragraph numbers. The paragraph mark (¶) should no longer be used. The neutral citation system for local judgments (7) A neutral citation is a court-approved system of citation which is independent of the series of law reports or other publications, and unique to each written judgment. Each written judgment from a particular level of court is assigned a sequential number, starting from 1 at the beginning of each calendar year. The application of the system is as follows: (a) Cases reported in the Singapore Law Reports must be cited using their Singapore Law Reports citations, in priority to their neutral citations. (b) Unreported decisions must be cited using their neutral citations. (8) Court designators Court Neutral citation Singapore Court of Appeal SGCA Singapore High Court (Appellate Division) SGHC(A) Singapore High Court (before 2 January 2021) or Singapore High Court (General Division) (on or after 2 January 2021) SGHC Family Division of the High Court SGHCF Singapore Family Courts SGFC Year of the decision SGYC Year of the decision SGDC (9) Example and explanation ABC Co Pte Ltd v XYZ Co Ltd [2015] SGFC 25, at [3], [8]. Year of the decision [2015] Level of Court SGFC (Singapore Family Courts) Sequential Number 25 (twenty-fifth written judgment rendered by the Family Court in 2015) Paragraph Number(s) Paragraphs 3 and 8 of the judgment Ancillary provisions (10) The Court in exercising its discretion as to costs may, where appropriate in the circumstances, take into account the extent to which counsel has complied with this paragraph. (11) Counsel’s attention is drawn to rule 859 of the Family Justice Rules which gives the Court the power to make an order for costs personally against errant advocates and solicitors, who have wasted or incurred costs unreasonably or improperly. The Court will not hesitate to invoke its powers under rule 859 of the Family Justice Rules in cases where costs have been wasted due to counsel’s indiscriminate citation of unnecessary and irrelevant secondary authorities. (12) It will remain the duty of counsel to draw the attention of the Court to any judgment he or she is aware of, not cited by an opponent, which is adverse to the case being advanced. (13) In addition, counsel should also comply with paragraphs 88(5) to (11) of these Practice Directions when preparing bundles of authorities for use in court. (14) This paragraph applies to all hearings, whether in open court or in chambers, in the Family Justice Courts."

"text": "94. Submissions and examination by leading and assisting counsel (1) In the event that a party is represented by more than one counsel at a hearing, whether in Court or in chambers, the making of submissions and the questioning of witnesses may be carried out by one counsel for each party only. (2) If a party would like submissions on different issues be made or certain portions of the examination, cross- examination or re-examination be conducted by different counsel, an oral application should be made to Court as early as is practicable and by no later than the commencement of the trial or hearing for leave to do so. The following information should be provided to the Court for the purposes of the application: (a) the issues on which each counsel will be making submissions; and/or (b) the witnesses to be examined, cross-examined or re-examined by each counsel, or the portions of their evidence for which each counsel will conduct the examination, cross-examination or re-examination. Nothing in this paragraph detracts from the responsibility of lead counsel to ensure that all counsel making submissions, or having conduct of any portion of the examination, cross-examination or re-examination of witnesses, are adequately supervised and able to handle the tasks assigned to them. (3) If leave has been granted in accordance with sub-paragraph (2), counsel should ensure that each confines himself to the issues or portions of evidence in respect of which leave was granted and that there is no overlap in the issues or the examination being dealt with by different counsel for the same party. Further, counsel must not repeat, clarify or expand on any submissions or portions thereof that have been made by another counsel for the same party or examine, cross-examine or re-examine witnesses on portions of their evidence dealt with by another counsel for the same party. (4) If leave of the Court is not sought in accordance with sub-paragraph (2), only one counsel will be allowed to make submissions or conduct examination for a party throughout the hearing. (5) For hearings in chambers, lead counsel are strongly encouraged to apprise the client of the benefits of allocating certain advocacy tasks to junior assisting counsel, including the potential benefits of reduced legal costs and increased focus by lead counsel on the main advocacy tasks, and to therefore consider obtaining instructions to make an application in accordance with sub-paragraph (2). In this regard, lead counsel are encouraged to consider that giving junior assisting counsel more opportunities for oral advocacy could potentially benefit the client and, at the same time, promote renewal of the Bar. (6) For civil trials: (a) Notwithstanding sub-paragraphs (1) and (2), and save where lead counsel is a junior counsel, the junior assisting counsel shall deliver the oral opening statement unless the Court otherwise orders; and (b) lead counsel are to inform the trial judge at the Judge Pre-Trial Conference (“JPTC”), or if a JPTC has not been fixed, at the start of the trial, whether their client will be making an application pursuant to sub-paragraph (2) above and, if so, the proposed division of advocacy tasks between lead counsel and junior assisting counsel. (7) This Paragraph shall apply to all proceedings in the Family Courts, Youth Courts and Family Division of the High Court."

"text": "95. Amendment of documents General requirements for amendment of any document (1) Except as otherwise provided by the provisions of this Paragraph, where any document (inclusive of any pleading) that has been filed in any proceedings is required to be amended and re-filed in Court, a fresh copy of the document with the amendments included must be prepared, regardless of the number and length of the amendments sought to be made. (2) The procedure for amending a document is as follows: (a) A fresh amended copy of the document should be produced. (b) The number of times the document has been amended shall be indicated (in brackets) after the name of the document. For this purpose, an amended document should be entitled “[document name] (Amendment No. 1)” or “[document name] (Amendment No. 2)”, or as appropriate. For example, a Statement of Claim which is amended for the first time should be filed as “Statement of Claim (Amendment No. 1)”, and a Defence that is amended for the second time should be filed as “Defence (Amendment No. 2)”. (c) The changes made in the document from the latest version of the document filed in Court should be indicated in the following way: (i) deletions shall be made by drawing a single line across the words to be deleted; and (ii) insertions shall be underlined. Colour scheme for amendments (3) In addition, the following colours shall be used to indicate the history of the amendments in the specified documents: (a) black for the first round of amendments; (b) red for the second round of amendments; (c) green for the third round of amendments; (d) blue for the fourth round of amendments; and (e) brown for subsequent rounds of amendments. Amendment for third time or more (4) From the third round of amendments onwards, the amended specified document should comprise two versions of the document, i.e. — (a) a clean version without the amendments shown; followed in the same document by (b) a version showing the amendments in colour. (5) Only one amended document consisting of these two versions is required to be filed. Cases to which the requirements in sub-paragraphs (1) and (2) do not apply (6) The directions in sub-paragraph (2)(b) above shall not apply to any originating summons or summons that has been amended from an inter partes application to an ex parte application or vice versa. (7) The directions in sub-paragraphs (2)(c) above shall not apply to any originating process, summons or other electronic form that is composed online through the Electronic Filing Service. Amendment endorsements on electronic forms (8) Rule 426(3) of the Family Justice Rules requires that an amended pleading or other document be endorsed with a statement that it has been amended, specifying the date on which it was amended and by whom the order (if any) authorising the amendment was made and the date thereof, and if no such order was made, the number of the Rule in Part 18 Division 14 of the Family Justice Rules in pursuance of which the amendment was made. (9) Where electronic forms are amended, the amendment endorsement shall take either one of the following forms: (a) “By order of court made on [date order was made]”; or (b) “Pursuant to Rule [cite specific rule number]”. (10) The amendment endorsement shall be appended to the title of the electronic form, after the amendment number as required under sub-paragraph (2)(b) above. Where an electronic form is amended more than once, the endorsement need only cite the basis for the most recent amendment. For example — (a) “Originating Summons (Amendment No. 3, by order of court made on 1 January 2013)”; (b) “Writ of Summons (Amendment No. 1, pursuant to r420)”. (11) The date of the electronic form shall reflect the date on which the document is amended. Amendments made on original writ or originating summons (where amendments are not numerous or lengthy) (12) This sub-paragraph applies to writs and originating summonses that have not been filed using the Electronic Filing Service. In addition to the usual endorsement signed by the solicitors pursuant to Paragraph 73 of these Practice Directions, there should be re- sealing of the document as required by rule 426(1), of the Family Justice Rules. The seal will be embossed over the endorsement. Amendment of case title to add a party (13) Where leave of Court has been obtained to add a party to the main case title of a matter, for example, an intervener, a garnishee or any party that was previously a non-party, the applicant or his solicitor is to file a Request through the Electronic Filing Service to add that specific party to the main case title."

Access to case file, inspection, taking copies of documents and conducting searches Access by parties to a case file (1) All parties to a case who are registered users of the Electronic Filing Service may, subject to this paragraph and any directions of the Court, access the electronic case file made available through the Electronic Filing Service and may inspect, download soft copies or print hard copies of documents accessible to the parties in the online case file. (2) Where a party to a case is not a registered user and is unable to access the electronic case file through the Electronic Filing Service, the procedure in sub-paragraph (5) below shall be followed. (3) All parties to a case have the liberty to make amendments to administrative details contained in the electronic case file through the Electronic Filing Service, and for this purpose — (a) administrative details include the contact details of solicitors, the identities of the solicitors, and the nature of the claim; and (b) where a party to a case is not a registered user of the Electronic Filing Service, he or she may attend at the service bureau to seek assistance to amend the administrative details contained in the electronic case file. (4) The Registry may require parties to a case to provide supporting documents to substantiate proposed amendments to other details of the electronic case file before the amendment is approved (e.g. amendments to add or remove a party to the case have to be supported by an order of court, and amendments to change the name, gender, identification number, or marital status of a party to the case have to be substantiated by documentary proof). File inspection by non-parties or parties who are not registered users (5) In order to inspect a case file, the following procedure should be followed: (a) A Request should be made to obtain leave to inspect the file, which request should — (i) be filed using the Electronic Filing Service; (ii) state the name of the person who is to carry out the search or inspection (and if this person is not a solicitor, his or her identification and contact details should also be included in the request, and his or her identification document (including physical or digital identity card) should be provided for verification when requested; (iii) state the interest the applicant has in the matter, and the reason for the search or inspection; and (iv) if the search or inspection is requested for the purpose of ascertaining information for use in a separate suit or matter, clearly state the nature of the information sought and the relevance of such information to the separate suit or matter. (b) Once approval for inspection has been received from the Court: (i) Registered users can inspect the case file online through the Electronic Filing Service; (ii) Parties who are not registered users can inspect the case file by presenting a copy of the approval at the service bureau. After verifying the approval, the service bureau will assign the inspecting party a personal computer for the inspection to be carried out. An inspecting party will usually be allowed 60 minutes to carry out the inspection. If a longer period is required, the service bureau may impose a charge for use of the computer. The service bureau may impose additional charges for downloading soft copies or printing hard copies of documents from the case file being inspected. (6) Requests in hard copy may be submitted to inspect case files containing documents which were not filed using the Electronic Filing Service. The Family Registry will only accept requests which are printed or typewritten on paper of good quality and signed by the solicitors concerned. Requests which have any erasure marks on them will be rejected. Requests which are double stamped, that is, if the requests were originally short stamped and later stamped to add up to the correct fee, may be rejected. (7) Solicitors must communicate to the Registrar in writing the names of their employees who have their authority to make searches and inspections. Such authority may be in respect of a specific search or inspection or for a specified period. (8) All copies of documents taken in the course of inspection should not be used for purposes other than those stated in the Request to inspect. Solicitors are responsible for informing their clients of this.

"text": "111. Swearing or affirming of affidavits, statutory declarations and oaths (1) Rule 8 of the Commissioners for Oaths Rules (Cap. 322, Rule 3) was amended effective 1 September 1998 to permit an advocate and solicitor who is appointed a commissioner for oaths to take affidavits or statutory declarations, or administer oaths to a deponent in a language or dialect, other than English, spoken or understood by the deponent and in which the advocate and solicitor is proficient in. Given these amendments, advocates and solicitors are requested to encourage their clients to use the services of other advocates and solicitors who are appointed commissioners for oaths and who are proficient in the language or dialect in which the affidavits or statutory declarations are to be sworn or affirmed, or in which the oaths are to be taken. The Family Justice Courts’ commissioners for oaths will continue to take affidavits or statutory declarations and administer oaths for legally aided cases and for parties who are acting in person who need to file documents in the Family Justice Courts. (2) If arrangements for the use of the services of advocates and solicitors who are appointed as commissioners for oaths are not possible, deponents who are blind or illiterate in English may continue to be brought by solicitors to the Family Justice Courts’ commissioners for oaths to swear or affirm affidavits and statutory declarations. As the Family Justice Courts’ commissioners for oaths are under a duty to ensure that the deponent understands the document being deposed to, they are obliged to interpret the document to intended deponents; this is also the case in relation to blind deponents. This necessary exercise may take a considerable time and may cause long delays for other persons who wish to take affidavits or statutory declarations before the Family Justice Courts’ commissioners for oaths. (3) Accordingly, solicitors who wish to bring illiterate or blind deponents before the Family Justice Courts’ commissioners for oaths should first estimate the time that will be taken to interpret the document or documents to be deposed to. If it is estimated that the total time required for interpretation of the documents will be more than 20 minutes, the solicitor must write to the Registrar and arrange for a special appointment for the documents to be sworn or affirmed; the solicitor should not bring the deponent before the duty commissioner for oaths without such an appointment. (4) If an illiterate or a blind deponent is brought before the duty Family Justice Courts commissioner for oaths and the interpretation of the document or documents takes more than 20 minutes, the commissioner for oaths will refer the solicitor and the deponent to the Registrar for a special appointment to be made for the documents to be deposed to. (5) Save in exceptional circumstances, the Family Justice Courts will not entertain requests from advocates and solicitors for its commissioners for oaths to swear or affirm affidavits or statutory declarations or administer oaths to a deponent outside the Family Justice Courts’ premises. Advocates and solicitors appointed as commissioners for oaths and who are proficient in the language or dialect in which the affidavits or statutory declarations are to be sworn or affirmed, or in which oaths are to be taken, are instead encouraged to perform this function."

No. (solicitors for plaintiff/solicitors for 1st defendant/2nd defendant/(or as the case may be)) : xxxxx.” (iv) Where no GST registration number has been allocated to a receiving party, a statement to this effect should be included after the GST registration numbers of the solicitors for the receiving parties, or the receiving parties, as the case may be, in the following manner: “ Solicitors for plaintiff/solicitors for 1st defendant/2nd defendant/(or as the case may be) : no GST Reg. No.” (b) Input tax allowable The proportion of input tax for which the receiving parties, or one or more of them, are not entitled to credit should be stated, as a percentage, in parentheses after the GST registration number of the party or parties concerned. For a person who is not liable to be registered within the meaning of the First Schedule to the Goods and Services Tax Act (Cap. 117A), this proportion should be 100%. (c) Apportionment (i) The first section of the bill of costs should set out the work done in the cause or matter except for taxation of costs. The amount of costs claimed for work done should be divided into as many parts corresponding with the different rates of GST applicable pursuant to section 16 of the Goods and Services Tax Act, its predecessor and any subsequent amendments thereto. Each part should state the global sum of costs claimed and the applicable GST rate for the relevant period. (ii) The second section which sets out the work done for and in the taxation of costs should describe the work done, the sum of costs claimed and the applicable GST rate. (iii) The third section, which sets out the disbursements made in the cause or matter, should first set out the disbursements on which no GST is chargeable by the solicitors for the receiving party or the receiving party as the case may be. For the disbursements on which GST is chargeable, it shall be divided into as many parts corresponding with the number of different rates of GST applicable pursuant to section 16 of the Goods and Services Tax Act, its predecessor and any subsequent amendments thereto. Each part should set out the disbursements on which GST is chargeable by the solicitors for the receiving party or the receiving party, as the case may be and the applicable GST rate. For example, for a matter which commenced in 1998 and concluded with a judgment in March 2003, with regard to disbursements on which GST is chargeable, the first part will set out the disbursements incurred on or before 1 January 2003 and the amount claimed for GST at the rate of 3%, while the second part will set out the disbursements incurred on or after 1 January 2003 and the amount claimed for GST at the rate of 4%. If a claim is made for disbursements incurred on or after 1 January 2004, the second part will set out the disbursements incurred on or after 1 January 2003 and before 1 January 2004, the amount claimed for GST at the rate of 4%, followed by a third part which shall set out the disbursements incurred on or after 1 January 2004 and the amount claimed for GST at the rate of 5% (or the applicable rate pursuant to section 16 of the Goods and Services Tax Act). (d) Summaries of the GST claimed for work done The following information as is applicable should be included at the end of the first and of the second sections: (i) the global sum of costs claimed for work done during each period for which a different rate of GST applies or no GST applies; (ii) the proportion, as a percentage, of input tax for which the receiving parties, or one or more of them, are not entitled to credit; (iii) a quantification of the input tax on the costs claimed in the section concerned for which the receiving parties, or one or more of them, are not entitled to credit; and (iv) quantifications of the GST claimed at the applicable rate on the costs claimed in the section concerned. (e) Summary of the GST claimed for disbursements The following information as is applicable should be included at the end of the third section: (i) a summation of the disbursements on which no GST is chargeable by the solicitors for the receiving party or the receiving party, as the case may be; (ii) a summation of the disbursements on which GST is chargeable by the solicitors for the receiving party or the receiving party, as the case may be; (iii) the proportion, as a percentage, of input tax for which the receiving parties, or one or more of them, are not entitled to credit; (iv) a quantification of the input tax on the disbursements on which GST is chargeable by the solicitors for the receiving party for which the receiving parties, or one or more of them, are not entitled to credit; and (v) quantifications of the GST claimed at the applicable rates on the disbursements. (f) Registrar’s certificate The total amount of GST allowed on a bill of costs will be indicated as a separate item in the Registrar’s certificate. Solicitors are responsible for ensuring that the GST figures accurately reflect the sums allowed by the Registrar."

Electronic payment of Court fees Implementation of electronic means for payment of Court fees (1) Subject to these Practice Directions, all court fees not paid using the Electronic Filing Service may be paid by electronic means. Modes of payment by electronic means (2) Payment through electronic means includes payment effected by Interbank GIRO (IBG), NETS and selected credit cards. For law firms with standing GIRO arrangements with the Family Justice Courts, payment by IBG would be the most appropriate mode of electronic payment where Court fees are paid over the counter. A law firm using IBG for such purposes will authorise the Family Justice Courts to deduct the fees from its bank account upon lodgement of the prescribed lodgement form. Scope of payment by electronic means (3) The electronic means of payment cover all Court fees previously collected over the counter and hearing fees in the Family Justice Courts. Registrar’s discretion (4) Unless otherwise approved by the Registrar, payment of Court fees collected over the counter must be made by electronic means. The Registrar may, in any case, waive the requirement for the payment to be effected by electronic means, on such terms and conditions as the Registrar deems fit."

"text": "158. Weekend / Public Holiday Duty Registrar and Judge at the Family Courts (1) The Duty Judge at the Family Courts may hear an urgent application from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m on Saturdays, Sundays and public holidays under the following circumstances: (a) where the applicant, being a lawful guardian or parent of a child, is seeking to restrain or enjoin another party from taking the child out of jurisdiction without the consent of the applicant; (b) the child’s departure from Singapore is so imminent that it would be too late for the application to be heard on the next working day; and (c) there is a strong likelihood that the child, once taken out of Singapore, will not return to Singapore. (2) To request the urgent hearing of such an application, the applicant should contact the Weekend / Public Holiday Duty Registrar at 97241402 during the hours of 9 a.m. to 6 p.m on Saturdays, Sundays and public holidays. (3) The Duty Registrar will only arrange for the hearing of the application before the Duty Judge if the applicant satisfies the Duty Registrar that the case meets all the criteria stipulated in sub-paragraph (1) and the application is so urgent that it cannot be heard the next working day. The Duty Registrar or Duty Judge may also give directions for the urgent hearing to take place remotely or, alternatively, with parties attending in person at any place as directed. (4) The Duty Registrar or the hearing judge may, in lieu of filing, direct the applicant to tender the application and supporting documents by email or in hard copies. In this case, the applicant is to provide a signed undertaking in accordance with Form 259 in Appendix A to these Practice Directions that all documents (including the originating process if applicable) will be filed in Court the next available working day. Where the Duty Registrar or the hearing judge directs the applicant to provide hard copies of the relevant documents, the applicant must bring three copies each of the application, the supporting affidavit and the appropriate draft orders of court (Form 260 in Appendix A to these Practice Directions) for the ex parte hearing. (5) On an ex parte application for an injunction against the permanent removal of a child from Singapore, the Court would require the applicant, to give an undertaking to compensate any party for any loss caused as a result of the application. The Court may require the undertaking as to damages to be supported by — (a) making payment into Court; (b) furnishing a banker’s guarantee; or (c) making payment to the applicant’s solicitor to be held by the solicitor as an officer of the Court pending further order. (6) An applicant for an order under section 14 of the Guardianship of Infants Act (Cap 122) must prepare the following documents in accordance with the appropriate forms in Appendix A to these Practice Directions and bring them along to the hearing: (a) the Order of Court being sought (Form 261 in Appendix A to these Practice Directions); (b) the Writ for Seizure (Form 262 in Appendix A to these Practice Directions); (c) the Request for Writ for Seizure (Form 263 in Appendix A to these Practice Directions); (d) the applicant’s letter of undertaking to indemnify the Family Justice Courts and the Bailiff against any liabilities or claims that may arise from or in connection with the execution of the order granted by the Court to the applicant (Form 264 in Appendix A to these Practice Directions); (e) the applicant’s letter of undertaking to pay compensation / damages and to serve the documents (Form 265 in Appendix A to these Practice Directions); and (f) the applicant’s counsel’s letter of undertaking to ensure a calm and orderly execution and to pay the costs, expenses and charges of execution should the same not be fully paid by the applicant (Form 266 in Appendix A to these Practice Directions) (7) The forms in Appendix A to these Practice Directions are intended to make it easier for persons served with the relevant orders to understand what the orders mean. These standard form orders should be used save to the extent that an applicant is of the view that the form should be varied and the Duty Judge hearing a particular application considers that there is a good reason for adopting a different form. Any departure from the terms of the standard forms must be justified by the applicant in his / her supporting affidavit(s). (8) If an order is granted under section 14 of the Guardianship of Infants Act (Cap 122), the applicant must do the following: (a) accompany the Bailiff to the place of execution and identify the child to be seized; (b) instruct his / her solicitor (if any) to accompany the Bailiff; (c) provide specific address of execution and if the execution is at an airport (whether Singapore Changi or Seletar), solicitor/applicant shall provide the details of flight and terminal number (boundary of seizure at the airport is restricted to public area); and (d) engage and pay for the costs of an auxiliary police officer to accompany the Bailiff to the place of execution, subject to the condition that where the person against whom the execution is to be carried out or the child / any of the children concerned is a female, the auxiliary police officer shall be a female officer. (9) For the avoidance of doubt, every applicant must comply with Paragraph 83 of these Practice Directions."

(5) Except where the attendance of the advocate and solicitor is required under sub- paragraph (9), the filing of the relevant documents will be sufficient for the Duty Registrar’s disposal of any application or matter. Documents which are filed using the Electronic Filing Service will be returned to the solicitor through the Electronic Filing Service to the inbox of the law firm’s computer system or through the service bureau. Documents which are not electronically filed shall be collected from the relevant Family Registry not earlier than one clear day after the documents have been filed. (6) All documents which are not required to be filed using the Electronic Filing Service should be duly stamped before presentation to the Duty Registrar for his signature and/or decision. (7) A solicitor who wishes to attend before a Duty Registrar and to refer him to documents filed using the Electronic Filing Service must either — (a) file the document sufficiently far in advance before attending before the Duty Registrar such that the documents are already included in the electronic case file for the Duty Registrar’s reference (and in this regard, solicitors should only attend before the Duty Registrar after they have received notification from the Court that the document has been accepted); or (b) attend before the Duty Registrar with the paper documents, if these exist (and in this regard, the Duty Registrar will require the solicitor to give an undertaking to file all the documents by the next working day after the attendance before dealing with the matter).

(11) When dealing with the ancillary matters, the Court may grant orders under section 31 of the Family Justice Act empowering the Registrar to sign the documents to effect the sale and transfer of matrimonial assets. These orders fall into two categories: (a) an order empowering the Registrar to sign the relevant documents without further notice to the party whom the Registrar is signing the documents on behalf of (“Category A orders”); and (b) an order empowering the Registrar to sign the relevant documents only in the event of a default by a party in signing the relevant documents (“the other party”) despite written notification to him/her to sign the relevant documents (“Category B orders”). (12) Applications to obtain the signature of the Registrar pursuant to Category A orders and Category B orders shall be made before the Duty Registrar in the Family Justice Courts. The documents to be signed by the Duty Registrar shall contain the following endorsements: “Signed on behalf of {insert name of party in default} by Registrar, Family Justice Courts, pursuant to order of court dated {insert date}” (13) Counsel shall furnish the following documents to the Duty Registrar when making such applications: (a) For Category A orders (i) The sealed copy of the order of court empowering the Registrar to sign the relevant documents; and (ii) A duplicate copy of each of the documents to be signed by the Registrar, which will be retained by the Court.

(2) An applicant requesting for an urgent hearing before a Duty District Judge or Assistant Registrar is required to file the request through the Electronic Filing Service. The request should be accompanied by the completed Form 270 of Appendix A of these Practice Directions. A copy of Form 270 should be served on each respondent to the application at the time of filing, unless the application is an ex parte application and service of Form 270 would or might defeat the purpose of the application. The Registry will update the applicant or parties (whichever applicable) on the outcome of the request. (3) The applicant should prepare skeletal submissions for the urgent hearing before the Duty District Judge, and file the skeletal submissions at the same time as Form 270. A copy of the skeletal submissions should be served on each respondent to the application at the time of filing, unless the application is an ex parte application and service of the skeletal submissions would or might defeat the purpose of the application. (4) If, due to urgency, the applicant is unable to file or serve Form 270 and/or the skeletal submissions before attending before the Duty District Judge, the applicant should provide a copy each of Form 270 and the skeletal submissions to each respondent to the application when the parties attend before the Duty District Judge. Each such copy of Form 270 or the skeletal submissions must be a hard copy, if the parties attend before the Duty District Judge physically, or in soft copy, if the parties attend before the Duty District Judge by live video or live television link. Thereafter, Form 270 and the skeletal submissions should be filed as soon as possible and, in any event, no later than the next working day after the attendance before the Duty District Judge, unless the Court directs otherwise. If any respondent does not attend before the Duty District Judge, Form 270 and the skeletal submissions should be served on that respondent as soon as possible after the hearing before the Duty District Judge, unless the Court directs otherwise. (5) In cases of extreme urgency where the applicant is unable to comply with the requirement to file or provide a copy of the skeletal submissions by the time of the urgent hearing before the Duty District Judge, the applicant should seek dispensation of that requirement and the supporting reasons for the dispensation request should be included in Form 270 filed pursuant to sub-paragraph (2). (6) The applicant’s skeletal submissions should contain the following: (a) the relevant facts; (b) the applicable law; (c) the reason(s) for requesting an urgent hearing; and (d) a summary of arguments. (7) The applicant’s skeletal submissions should be in the following format: (a) all pages should be paginated; (b) the skeletal submissions should not exceed 10 pages (excluding the cover page and backing page); (c) the minimum font size to be used is Times New Roman 12 or its equivalent; (d) the print of every page must be double-spaced; and (e) every page must have a margin on all 4 sides, each of at least 35mm in width. Request for urgent hearing before Judge of the Family Division of the High Court (8) In the event that a request is for an urgent hearing before a Judge of the Family Division of the High Court, unless otherwise directed, sub-paragraphs (2) to (7) shall apply save that references to the Duty District Judge shall be read as references to the Judge of the Family Division of the High Court."

Attendance of solicitors in Court (1) Save in the most exceptional and unforeseen circumstances, and so long as the firm of solicitors remains on record, a member of the firm must attend all proceedings in respect of the cause or matter in which the firm is acting, even if it does not intend to oppose the orders sought by the other side. The practice of asking the opposing solicitor to mention the matter on one’s behalf is also not acceptable and should be discouraged. (2) The court may however allow a solicitor appearing in any cause or matter to mention for counsel for all other parties provided that: (a) the solicitor obtains confirmation of his authority to mention on their behalf for the purpose of the hearing; and (b) parties have agreed on the order sought. (3) However, where an adjournment of the hearing date of any cause or matter is sought, solicitors for all parties must attend the hearing. See also paragraphs 100 and 168 of these Practice Directions. (4) Solicitors appearing in any cause or matter should be punctual in attending Court, as delay in the commencement of the hearing leads to wastage of judicial time. Appropriate sanctions may be imposed for solicitors who do not arrive for hearings on time."

If a letter is sent to the Court by a law firm in any other way, it is liable to be rejected. This sub-paragraph does not apply to litigants in person. (3) In addition, all letters should be captioned with the number of the cause to which they relate and the names of the parties. For example: ‘DIVORCE WRIT NO. 12345 OF 2015 Between AB and CD’ (4) If the correspondence relates to an interlocutory application or applications, the reference number, hearing date and time of that application or those applications should be stated in the caption below the parties’ names.

Unilateral requests made without first seeking the consent or views of the other party or parties to the matter will not be entertained, except in the most exceptional circumstances. (7) If the consent of all other parties to the matter is obtained, the request should state that all parties have consented to the request for the adjournment or vacation. However, this does not mean that the request will be granted as a matter of course. The Court will still evaluate the merits of the request before making its decision. (8) If the consent of one or more of the other parties is not obtained, the request should set out the reasons for the other parties’ objections, or explain why the consent of one or more of the other parties cannot be obtained. Any relevant correspondence between the parties should also be annexed. The Court will then evaluate the contents of the request and the relevant correspondence before deciding whether the request should be allowed. (8A) In any other case, parties must attend before the Court to make an application for an adjournment. See also paragraph 160 of these Practice Directions. (9) Where the reason for rescheduling of the hearing is a conflict of court dates, the following information relating to both court cases must be stated in the request: (a) the case number; (b) the date and time of the hearing; (c) the nature of hearing; (d) the date when the applicant was informed of the hearing date or agreed to accept the hearing date (e.g. date of Registrar’s Notice or date of case conference or Court mentions when the date was taken); (e) in the event the family proceedings hearing date was fixed earlier, whether the court subsequently giving the same hearing date was informed of the family proceedings hearing already fixed; and (f) in the event the family proceedings hearing date was fixed later, whether the Family Justice Courts was informed of the earlier hearing date and the reasons for the earlier date.

(14) The Request should contain the following information: (a) the Case number; (b) the parties to the suit; (c) the names of witnesses requiring an interpreter; (d) the Court/Chamber number; (e) the stage of the proceedings (e.g. fresh or adjourned hearing); (f) the date and time of hearing (in the event the hearing is fixed for more than 1 day, the date and time on which the interpreter’s services are required); (g) the number of days for which the interpreter’s services are required; and (h) the language/dialect spoken by the witnesses requiring the services of the interpreter.
