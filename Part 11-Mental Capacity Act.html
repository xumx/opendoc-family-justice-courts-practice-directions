  <main class="site-main" id="main-content" aria-label="Content"><h1 id="part-xi--mental-capacity-act">Part XI – Mental Capacity Act</h1>

<h2 id="45-proceedings-under-the-mental-capacity-act-cap-177a">45. Proceedings under the Mental Capacity Act (Cap 177A)</h2>

<p>(deleted)</p>

<h2 id="46-documents-to-be-filed">46. Documents to be filed</h2>

<p>(1) The originating summons, application forms and supporting affidavits for mental capacity proceedings are to be filed in the Family Justice Courts.</p>

<p>(2) The Court may reject any document filed if there are errors or if the document does not comply with the Family Justice Rules, these Practice Directions, or any other directions made by the Court.</p>

<p>(3) Explanatory text in Form 217 in Appendix A to these Practice Directions should be excluded from the originating summons. Also, where a choice is set out in the form (e.g. Deputy / Deputies), the inapplicable choice should be deleted.</p>

<h2 id="47-where-permission-is-not-required-to-make-an-application">47. Where permission is not required to make an application</h2>

<p>(1) The definition of “P” in rule 175 of the Family Justice Rules shall be applicable in these Practice Directions. “P” means a person who lacks or, so far as consistent with the context, is alleged to lack capacity (within the meaning of the Mental Capacity Act) and to whom any proceedings under the Mental Capacity Act (Cap. 177A) relate.</p>

<p>(2) If the plaintiff or applicant falls or believes himself to fall within the categories of persons who do not require permission to file an application, this shall be stated in the supporting affidavit. Relevant documents, such as copies of birth certificates or marriage certificates, of the lasting powers of attorney or of the court orders appointing the deputies shall be exhibited to support the averment that no permission is required for an application under the Mental Capacity Act.</p>

<h2 id="48-where-permission-is-required-to-make-an-application">48. Where permission is required to make an application</h2>

<p>(1) Apart from the categories listed in section 38 of the Mental Capacity Act (Cap. 177A), permission is required for an application to the Court under the Mental Capacity Act.</p>

<p>(2) Where permission is required, that prayer may be included in the main application itself. There is no requirement for a separate application for permission. The grounds upon which the plaintiff or applicant is relying to obtain such permission must be stated clearly in the supporting affidavit. The Court will decide whether to grant such permission based on the grounds relied upon by the plaintiff or applicant.</p>

<h2 id="49-service-of-application-on-named-defendants-and-relevant-persons">49. Service of application on named defendants and relevant persons</h2>

<p>(1) Rule 179 of the Family Justice Rules requires the plaintiff to serve the application, together with each affidavit or other document filed in support of the application, on each person named as a defendant in the proceedings and on each relevant person.</p>

<p>(2) In a situation where there are no named defendants, the application shall still be served on relevant persons.</p>

<p>(3) Service on a named defendant shall be by way of personal service. Service on relevant persons may be by way of ordinary service pursuant to rule 902 of the Family Justice Rules, unless directed otherwise by the Court.</p>

<p>(4) Where a relevant person resides overseas and the plaintiff or applicant is able to show that an electronic mail account to which the document will be sent belongs to the relevant person to be served and that it is currently active, the Court may permit service on such a relevant person to be carried out by way of electronic email. The grounds upon which the plaintiff or applicant is relying to obtain such permission must be stated clearly in the supporting affidavit.</p>

<p>(5) Subject to the timelines specified under rule 179(2) of the Family Justice Rules, one affidavit of service may be filed in respect of service on all the named defendants and relevant persons in any application. The dates, times and manner of service for each of the named defendants and relevant persons have to be stated clearly in the affidavit of service.</p>

<h2 id="50-relevant-persons">50. Relevant persons</h2>

<p>(1) “Relevant persons” are persons who have an involvement in P’s life and/or who are likely to have an interest in the application. Often, P’s immediate family members, by virtue of their relationship to P, are likely to have an interest in being notified that an application has been made to the Court concerning P.</p>

<p>(2) ‘Relevant persons’ for the purposes of Rule 176A and 179 of the Family Justice Rules will therefore often include the following immediate family members:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(a) P’s spouse;</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>(b) P’s children (aged 21 and above);</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>(c) P’s parents or guardians; and</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>(d) P’s brothers or sisters (aged 21 and above).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(3) However, the presumption that immediate family members are likely to have an interest in an application concerning P may be rebutted where the plaintiff or applicant is aware of circumstances which reasonably indicate that P’s immediate family should not be served. For example, where the family member in question has had little or no involvement in P’s life and has shown no inclination to do so, that family member need not be served. In some cases, P may be closer to persons who are not immediate family members and if so, it will be appropriate to effect service on them instead of the immediate family members.</p>

<p>(4) The plaintiff or applicant should serve the application, the supporting affidavits and the Notice to Relevant Person in Form 222 in Appendix A to these Practice Directions on relevant persons.</p>

<p>(5) Where the plaintiff or applicant decides that a person listed in one of the categories in sub-paragraph (2) ought to be served, and there are other persons in that category (for example, P has three siblings), the plaintiff or applicant should serve on all persons falling within that category unless there is a good reason not to do so. For example, it may be a good reason not to serve on every person in the category if one or more of them has had little or no involvement in P’s life and has shown no inclination to do so.</p>

<p>(6) Apart from immediate family members, other relevant persons who are likely to have an interest in the application concerning P and who should be served the application, the supporting affidavits and the Notice to Relevant Person in Form 222 in Appendix A to these Practice Directions include:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(a) any other relatives or friends who have a close relationship with P;</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>(b) any person who has a legal duty to support P;</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>(c) any person who will benefit from P’s estate; and</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>(d) any person who is responsible for P’s care.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If there is no such person to the best of the plaintiff’s or applicant’s knowledge, he is to state this in his supporting affidavit.</p>

<p>(7) The details of all relevant persons who should be served are to be listed clearly in the supporting affidavit of the plaintiff or applicant. Where service would not be effected on relevant persons who should be served, the reason why this is so must be stated in the supporting affidavit.</p>

<p>(8) In cases where P has had severe intellectual disability since early childhood and where P’s parents are P’s sole caregivers and where P is now no longer a minor and P’s parents need to be authorised to continue to look after P’s affairs, P’s parents would normally be the only relevant persons for the purposes of the application but the applicants must provide sufficient information to enable the Court to reach the conclusion that there are no other relevant persons.</p>

<p>(9) Organisations providing residential accommodation to P</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(a) If P resides at an organisation providing residential accommodation (regardless of whether it also provides care or treatment to P), the plaintiff or applicant shall serve the application, the supporting affidavits and the Notice to Relevant Person in Form 222 in Appendix A to these Practice Directions on such an organisation as soon as possible and in any event, not more than 2 working days after the application has been filed. For the purposes of the application, the organisation providing residential accommodation to P shall be considered a relevant person. However, the plaintiff or applicant need not obtain the consent of such an organisation to the application.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>(b) If the organisation providing residential accommodation to P wishes to furnish any relevant information for the Court’s consideration and determination of the application in the best interests of P, it shall notify the Court within 8 days after the date on which the organisation is served with the application. If such a notification is submitted, the Court may require and direct for the submission of a report and/or attendance of the maker of the report at the hearing of the application.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>(c) If an applicant has a strong reason for not serving an affidavit or any other document (other than the originating summons) on the organisation providing residential accommodation to P, the applicant may file a summons to seek dispensation of service of such documents on the organisation in question.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="51-consent-of-relevant-persons">51. Consent of relevant persons</h2>

<p>(1) If any relevant person to be served has consented to the application and to dispensation of service, the plaintiff or applicant shall file the consent of the relevant person in Form 221 in Appendix A to these Practice Directions together with the application. The consent given by the relevant person to the application and to dispensation of service must be attested by a solicitor, a Commissioner for Oaths, a notary public or any person for the time being authorised by law in the place where the document is executed to administer oaths.</p>

<p>(2) The Court may dispense with the service of the application on the relevant person on the application of the plaintiff or applicant. It should be stated clearly in the supporting affidavit that such relevant persons have given their consent to the application and to the dispensation of service.</p>

<h2 id="52-notification-of-p">52. Notification of P</h2>

<p>(1) In all cases of notification, the person effecting notification must provide P with the information required under rule 181 of Family Justice Rules in a way that is appropriate to P’s circumstances (for example, using simple language, visual aids or any other appropriate means).</p>

<p>(2) The certificate of notification filed under rule 181(5) of the Family Justice Rules shall be in Form 223 in Appendix A to these Practice Directions.</p>

<p>(3) Under the Mental Capacity Act, notification of P shall be the norm rather than the exception. However, in certain appropriate circumstances, the person required to notify P may apply to Court for an order to dispense with the requirement to notify P. Such an application would be appropriate where, for example, P is in a permanent vegetative state or a minimally conscious state, or where notification is likely to cause significant and disproportionate distress to P. The reasons for seeking dispensation of notification shall be stated in the supporting affidavit of the plaintiff or applicant.</p>

<h2 id="53-responding-to-an-application">53. Responding to an application</h2>

<p>(1) If a relevant person served with an application wishes to object to the application or any part of it, he must apply to the Court to be joined as a party to the proceedings within 21 days after the date on which he was served with the application. The application to be joined as a party to the proceedings shall be in Form 4 in Appendix A to these Practice Directions and be supported by an affidavit stating his interest in the application and the grounds of his objection.</p>

<p>(2) If a relevant person served with an application consents to the application, his written consent must be attested by a solicitor, a Commissioner for Oaths, a notary public or any person for the time being authorised by law in the place where the document is executed to administer oaths and must be in Form 221 in Appendix A to these Practice Directions. The written consent should be filed by the plaintiff or applicant within 21 days after the date on which the relevant person was served with the application.</p>

<p>(3) Where a person who was not served with any application (whether listed as a relevant person or otherwise in the supporting affidavit of the plaintiff or applicant) wishes to be heard in the proceedings, he must apply to be joined as a party to the proceedings in Form 4 in Appendix A to these Practice Directions.</p>

<h2 id="54-applications-involving-the-appointment-of-deputies">54. Applications involving the appointment of deputies</h2>

<p><strong>The prayers</strong></p>
