### Court Ordered Private Mediation

(2) With effect from 1 January 2019, the Court will no longer conduct mediation in relation to proceedings (including divorce proceedings, applications pursuant to section 121B of the Women’s Charter (Cap. 353) and proceedings for a grant of probate or letters of administration in respect of the estate and effects of a deceased person) which meet the following criteria:

(3) The Registrar or the Judge may order that parties in proceedings which meet the criteria attend private mediation conducted, at parties’ election,  by the Singapore Mediation Centre or the Law Society Mediation Scheme (collectively referred to as “Assigned Private Mediator(s)”), unless parties have agreed upon a mediator (“Agreed Private Mediator”). The Registrar or the Judge may also make any orders necessary, including any orders relating to the choice of mediator (if parties are unable to agree) and pertaining to the payment of the mediation and its related fees.

The Registrar or the Judge will fix a return date for parties and/or counsel to update the Court on the outcome of the private mediation.

(5) <ins>For mediations conducted by the Agreed Private Mediators</ins>, the parties or their counsel shall inform the Registrar or the Judge of the identity of their Agreed Private Mediator, the management of the mediation and the agreed date for mediation.

(6) Parties and their counsel must personally attend all mediation sessions, unless otherwise stated by the private mediator.

(7) For nullity, divorce and judicial separation proceedings in which interim judgment or judgment of judicial separation has been granted, if the dispute is resolved at private mediation, the parties and/or counsel may file the draft consent order for the Court’s approval in accordance with the requirements in Paragraph 116 of these Practice Directions. Alternatively, the parties may request to attend before the Court for the privately mediated agreement to be recorded as a consent order by the Registrar or the Judge upon confirmation of the terms by the parties and/or counsel.

(8) Where interim judgment or judgment of judicial separation has not been granted, if the dispute is resolved at private mediation, the parties and/or counsel shall inform the Court accordingly on the return date given by the Registrar or the Judge pursuant to sub-paragraphs (4) or (5) above, as the case may be, and directions will be given for the setting down of the divorce on an uncontested basis on an expedited basis.

(9) For all other proceedings not covered by sub-paragraphs (7) and (8) above, parties and/or counsel may either file the draft consent order in accordance with Paragraph 116 of these Practice Directions, or have it recorded as a consent order by the Registrar or the Judge upon the confirmation of the terms by the parties and/or counsel.

(10) If the dispute is not resolved at the private mediation, the Registrar or the Judge will give the necessary directions at the return date to enable the case to proceed accordingly.

### Mediation conducted by the Court

(11) For child-related proceedings, a Family Dispute Resolution Conference (“FDR Conference”) will be called to crystallise the issues of contention. All parties together with their counsel (if any) will have to attend the FDR Conference. At the FDR Conference, directions may be given in relation to the filing and exchanging of relevant documents and/or proposals. Parties will also be directed to attend mediation and/or counselling, whichever is appropriate.

(12) For non-child related proceedings, the Registrar or the Judge may direct parties to attend mediation and/or counselling, whichever is appropriate.
