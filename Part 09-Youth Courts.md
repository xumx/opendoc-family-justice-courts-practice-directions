## 32. Magistrate's complaints (Private summonses)

(1) Framing of criminal charges

Solicitors representing the complainants (save in maintenance cases) are to frame and submit the charges when the complaints are filed. This will facilitate the immediate issuance of the summons if it is so ordered by the Duty Magistrate.

(2) Infringement of copyright/trademarks

Magistrate's complaints involving infringement of copyright/trademarks must be sworn by authorised representatives. A letter of authorization to that effect must be attached to the complaint.

(3) Service of summons by solicitors' clerks

> (a) Solicitors are informed that any summons issued pursuant to Section 153 Criminal Procedure Code 2010 must be served at least 7 days before the return date of the summons if such service is undertaken by the firm’s clerk. This is because the authorization to serve will lapse 7 days before the return date.

> (b) If the summons is already served on the respondent 7 days before the mention date, the attached summons must be returned to the Youth Court Registry immediately after service. Failure to do so will result in the summons not being listed for mention.

> (c) If the summons cannot be served on the respondent 1 week before the mention date, the authorization to serve will lapse. In order to obtain further authorization for the firm's clerk to serve the summons on the respondent or to obtain an extension of the return date, the solicitor must appear before the Duty Magistrate *not later than 5 days before the return date.* Failure to comply with this may result in the complaint being struck off the list.
