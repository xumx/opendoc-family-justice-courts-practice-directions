(1) The Duty Judge at the Family Courts may hear an urgent application from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m on Saturdays, Sundays and public holidays under the following circumstances:

> (a) where the applicant, being a lawful guardian or parent of a child, is seeking to restrain or enjoin another party from taking the child out of jurisdiction without the consent of the applicant;

> (b) the child’s departure from Singapore is so imminent that it would be too late for the application to be heard on the next working day; and

> (c) there is a strong likelihood that the child, once taken out of Singapore, will not return to Singapore.

(2) To request the urgent hearing of such an application, the applicant should contact the Weekend / Public Holiday Duty Registrar at 97241402 during the hours of 9 a.m. to 6 p.m on Saturdays, Sundays and public holidays.

(3) The Duty Registrar will only arrange for the hearing of the application before the Duty Judge if the applicant satisfies the Duty Registrar that the case meets all the criteria stipulated in sub-paragraph (1) and the application is so urgent that it cannot be heard the next working day. The Duty Registrar or Duty Judge may also give directions for the urgent hearing to take place remotely or, alternatively, with parties attending in person at any place as directed.

(4) The Duty Registrar or the hearing judge may, in lieu of filing, direct the applicant to tender the application and supporting documents by email or in hard copies. In this case, the applicant is to provide a signed undertaking in accordance with Form 259 in Appendix A to these Practice Directions that all documents (including the originating process if applicable) will be filed in Court the next available working day. Where the Duty Registrar or the hearing judge directs the applicant to provide hard copies of the relevant documents, the applicant must bring three copies each of the application, the supporting affidavit and the appropriate draft orders of court (Form 260 in Appendix A to these Practice Directions) for the ex parte hearing.

(5) On an ex parte application for an injunction against the permanent removal of a child from Singapore, the Court would require the applicant, to give an undertaking to compensate any party for any loss caused as a result of the application. The Court may require the undertaking as to damages to be supported by —

> (a) making payment into Court;

> (b) furnishing a banker's guarantee; or

> (c) making payment to the applicant's solicitor to be held by the solicitor as an officer of the Court pending further order.

(6) An applicant for an order under section 14 of the Guardianship of Infants Act (Cap 122) must prepare the following documents in accordance with the appropriate forms in Appendix A to these Practice Directions and bring them along to the hearing:

> (a) the Order of Court being sought (Form 261 in Appendix A to these Practice Directions);

> (b) the Writ for Seizure (Form 262 in Appendix A to these Practice Directions);

> (c) the Request for Writ for Seizure (Form 263 in Appendix A to these Practice Directions);

> (d) the applicant’s letter of undertaking to indemnify the Family Justice Courts and the Bailiff against any liabilities or claims that may arise from or in connection with the execution of the order granted by the Court to the applicant (Form 264 in Appendix A to these Practice Directions);

> (e) the applicant’s letter of undertaking to pay compensation / damages and to serve the documents (Form 265 in Appendix A to these Practice Directions); and

> (f) the applicant’s counsel’s letter of undertaking to ensure a calm and orderly execution and to pay the costs, expenses and charges of execution should the same not be fully paid by the applicant (Form 266 in Appendix A to these Practice Directions)

(7) The forms in Appendix A to these Practice Directions are intended to make it easier for persons served with the relevant orders to understand what the orders mean. These standard form orders should be used save to the extent that an applicant is of the view that the form should be varied and the Duty Judge hearing a particular application considers that there is a good reason for adopting a different form. Any departure from the terms of the standard forms must be justified by the applicant in his / her supporting affidavit(s).

(8) If an order is granted under section 14 of the Guardianship of Infants Act (Cap 122), the applicant must do the following:

> (a) accompany the Bailiff to the place of execution and identify the child to be seized;

> (b) instruct his / her solicitor (if any) to accompany the Bailiff;

> (d) engage and pay for the costs of an auxiliary police officer to accompany the Bailiff to the place of execution, subject to the condition that where the person against whom the execution is to be carried out or the child / any of the children concerned is a female, the auxiliary police officer shall be a female officer.

(11) When dealing with the ancillary matters, the Court may grant orders under section 31 of the Family Justice Act empowering the Registrar to sign the documents to effect the sale and transfer of matrimonial assets. These orders fall into two categories:

> (a) an order empowering the Registrar to sign the relevant documents without further notice to the party whom the Registrar is signing the documents on behalf of (“Category A orders”); and

> (b) an order empowering the Registrar to sign the relevant documents only in the event of a default by a party in signing the relevant documents (“the other party”) despite written notification to him/her to sign the relevant documents (“Category B orders”).

(2)	An applicant requesting for an urgent hearing before a Duty District Judge or Assistant Registrar is required to file the request through the Electronic Filing Service. The request should be accompanied by the completed Form 270 of Appendix A of these Practice Directions. A copy of Form 270 should be served on each respondent to the application at the time of filing, unless the application is an ex parte application and service of Form 270 would or might defeat the purpose of the application. The Registry will update the applicant or parties (whichever applicable) on the outcome of the request.

(3)	The applicant should prepare skeletal submissions for the urgent hearing before the Duty District Judge, and file the skeletal submissions at the same time as Form 270. A copy of the skeletal submissions should be served on each respondent to the application at the time of filing, unless the application is an ex parte application and service of the skeletal submissions would or might defeat the purpose of the application.

(4)	If, due to urgency, the applicant is unable to file or serve Form 270 and/or the skeletal submissions before attending before the Duty District Judge, the applicant should provide a copy each of Form 270 and the skeletal submissions to each respondent to the application when the parties attend before the Duty District Judge. Each such copy of Form 270 or the skeletal submissions must be a hard copy, if the parties attend before the Duty District Judge physically, or in soft copy, if the parties attend before the Duty District Judge by live video or live television link. Thereafter, Form 270 and the skeletal submissions should be filed as soon as possible and, in any event, no later than the next working day after the attendance before the Duty District Judge, unless the Court directs otherwise. If any respondent does not attend before the Duty District Judge, Form 270 and the skeletal submissions should be served on that respondent as soon as possible after the hearing before the Duty District Judge, unless the Court directs otherwise.

(5)	In cases of extreme urgency where the applicant is unable to comply with the requirement to file or provide a copy of the skeletal submissions by the time of the urgent hearing before the Duty District Judge, the applicant should seek dispensation of that requirement and the supporting reasons for the dispensation request should be included in Form 270 filed pursuant to sub-paragraph (2).

<ul type="*">

<li>(a)	all pages should be paginated;</li>

<li>(b)	the skeletal submissions should not exceed 10 pages (excluding the cover page and backing page);</li>

<li>(c)	the minimum font size to be used is Times New Roman 12 or its equivalent;</li>

<li>(d)	the print of every page must be double-spaced; and</li>

<li>(e)	every page must have a margin on all 4 sides, each of at least 35mm in width.</li>

</ul>

***Request for urgent hearing before Judge of the Family Division of the High Court***

(8)	In the event that a request is for an urgent hearing before a Judge of the Family Division of the High Court, unless otherwise directed, sub-paragraphs (2) to (7) shall apply save that references to the Duty District Judge shall be read as references to the Judge of the Family Division of the High Court.

## 160. Attendance of solicitors in Court

(1) Save in the most exceptional and unforeseen circumstances, and so long as the firm of solicitors remains on record, a member of the firm must attend all proceedings in respect of the cause or matter in which the firm is acting, even if it does not intend to oppose the orders sought by the other side. The practice of asking the opposing solicitor to mention the matter on one's behalf is also not acceptable and should be discouraged.

(2) The court may however allow a solicitor appearing in any cause or matter to mention for counsel for all other parties provided that:

> (a) the solicitor obtains confirmation of his authority to mention on their behalf for the purpose of the hearing; and

> (b) parties have agreed on the order sought.

(3)	However, where an adjournment of the hearing date of any cause or matter is sought, solicitors for all parties must attend the hearing. See also paragraphs 100 and 168 of these Practice Directions.

(4)	Solicitors appearing in any cause or matter should be punctual in attending Court, as delay in the commencement of the hearing leads to wastage of judicial time. Appropriate sanctions may be imposed for solicitors who do not arrive for hearings on time.

## 161. Use of Video or Telephone Conferencing for Hearings

(1) These directions apply to hearings to be conducted by video or telephone conferencing, as directed by the Court.

**<u>Guidelines for Video and Telephone Conferencing </u>**

(9) In the event of non-compliance with the required technical specifications, prescribed Court etiquette or the applicable Guidelines, the Court may adjourn the hearing and issue further directions to be complied with.

> **‘DIVORCE WRIT NO. 12345 OF 2015**

> **Between AB and CD’**

(4) If the correspondence relates to an interlocutory application or applications, the reference number, hearing date and time of that application or those applications should be stated in the caption below the parties' names. For example:

> **"SUMMONS NO. 98765 OF 2015**

> **CASE CONFERENCE ON 1 JANUARY 2015 at 2:30PM"**

**_Request to adjourn, reschedule or vacate a hearing date_**

(5) A request for a hearing date to be rescheduled shall be made via the electronic filing service  as soon as possible and at least 7 working days prior to the hearing date.

(6) Before parties write to the Court to request an adjournment or vacation of any hearing other than a trial, they should seek the consent of the other party or parties to the matter. Unilateral requests made without first seeking the consent or views of the other party or parties to the matter will not be entertained, except in the most exceptional circumstances.

(7) If the consent of all other parties to the matter is obtained, the request should state that all parties have consented to the request for the adjournment or vacation. However, this does not mean that the request will be granted as a matter of course. The Court will still evaluate the merits of the request before making its decision.

(8) If the consent of one or more of the other parties is not obtained, the request should set out the reasons for the other parties’ objections, or explain why the consent of one or more of the other parties cannot be obtained. Any relevant correspondence between the parties should also be annexed. The Court will then evaluate the contents of the request and the relevant correspondence before deciding whether the request should be allowed.

(8A)	In any other case, parties must attend before the Court to make an application for an adjournment. See also paragraph 160 of these Practice Directions.

(9) Where the reason for rescheduling of the hearing is a conflict of court dates, the following information relating to both court cases must be stated in the request:

> (a) the case number;

> (b) the date and time of the hearing;

> (c) the nature of hearing;

> (d) the date when the applicant was informed of the hearing date or agreed to accept the hearing date (e.g. date of Registrar’s Notice or date of case conference or Court mentions when the date was taken);

> (e) in the event the family proceedings hearing date was fixed earlier, whether the court subsequently giving the same hearing date was informed of the family proceedings hearing already fixed; and

> (f) in the event the family proceedings hearing date was fixed later, whether the Family Justice Courts was informed of the earlier hearing date and the reasons for the earlier date.

(10) Compliance with the directions in this Paragraph will facilitate the expeditious location of the relevant cause file.

(11) If a letter is sent to the Court by a law firm without the information specified in sub- paragraph (3) and (4), it is also liable to be rejected.

(12) All correspondence to Court relating to or in connection with any pending matter shall be copied to all other parties in the matter or to their solicitors unless there are good reasons for not so doing. Solicitors are further reminded that the Court should not be copied on correspondence between parties or their solicitors. The Registry has the discretion to reject or refuse to act on any inappropriate or _ex parte_ correspondence.

(13) Registrar’s Directions and Notices from the Registry will be sent to law firms who are registered users of the Electronic Filing Service through the Electronic Filing Service.

(14) Registered users are to ensure that the inbox of their Electronic Filing Service account(s) are checked and cleared regularly.
